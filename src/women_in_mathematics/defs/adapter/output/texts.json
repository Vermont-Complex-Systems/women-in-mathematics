March 7, 1893\u2013September 28, 1985.\nKansas State Agricultural College (BS 1929), Catholic University of Amer-\nica (MA 1930, PhD 1933).\n\nCatherine Helen Arnoldy, born in Tipton, Kansas, was the eighth of nine children\nof Anna (Holz) (1855\u20131944) and Nicholas Arnoldy (1845\u20131920). Her mother was\nborn in Iowa; her father, born in Germany, had emigrated with his family and\nsettled in Iowa when he was nine. Both attended school through the eighth grade.\nThey married in Iowa and in 1879 moved to Tipton, Kansas, where her father\nwas a storekeeper. The \ufb01rst child of the marriage, Catherine, died as an infant\nin 1877. Her other siblings were John Peter (1878\u20131959), Elizabeth (1881\u20131911),\nEdward Conrad (1884\u20131886), George Matthew (1886\u20131979), Charles John (1888\u2013\n1909), Mary E. (1891\u20131976), and Leo Matthew (1896\u20131976).\n\nCatherine Arnoldy attended parochial school in Tipton and did her high school\nwork at the Nazareth Academy in Concordia, Kansas, before entering the Nazareth\nConvent in 1910 and making her profession of vows in 1912. All three surviving\ndaughters became Sisters of St. Joseph. The eldest daughter, Sister Modesta, died at\ntwenty-nine; Sister Domitilla became a biologist and taught at Marymount College\nin Salina, Kansas, where Sister Mary Nicholas was to spend most of her career.\n\nIn the seventeen years before she entered the Catholic University of America for\ngraduate work, Sister Mary Nicholas had various teaching assignments in Kansas;\nthese included schools in Schoenchen, Emmeram, Antonino, and Manhattan. In this\nsame period she was doing her undergraduate work. From 1921 to 1923 she attended\nthe Fort Hays Kansas State Normal School (now Fort Hays State University), and\nin 1923\u201324 she was among the \ufb01rst women to attend teachers\u2019 courses at Creighton\nUniversity, a Jesuit institution in Omaha, Nebraska. She received her bachelor\u2019s de-\ngree from Kansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University) in 1929\nafter studying there during the \ufb01rst semesters of 1924\u201325 and 1928\u201329 and summer\nsessions every summer from 1924 until 1929, except for the summer of 1928 when\nshe studied at Creighton. She also took one course in music from Manhattanville\nCollege of the Sacred Heart, Pius X School of Liturgical Music, New York, in each\nof the winters of 1923, 1924, 1925.\n\nSister Mary Nicholas entered Catholic University in 1929, received her master\u2019s\ndegree in 1930, and completed her doctoral work in September 1932 with minors in\nphysics and education. She then taught for the next thirty-four years at Marymount\nCollege in Salina, Kansas. Founded in 1922 by the Congregation of the Sisters of St.\nJoseph, Marymount was the \ufb01rst four-year liberal arts college for women in Kansas.\nShe was director of the mathematics department and, for several years, was the only\nmathematics instructor; at various times she was also the college registrar.\n\nAfter her retirement from Marymount College in 1966, two years before it became\ncoeducational, Sister Mary Nicholas taught at Sacred Heart High School in Salina;\nNotre Dame High School in Concordia; and then worked part time at Central\nCatholic High School in Grand Island, Nebraska. She was known for her hard work,\nfor her love of gardening, and for her mastery of tatting. She was taciturn and had\na very dry sense of humor.\n\nAt age eighty Sister Mary Nicholas retired to Medaille Center in Salina. At\nninety she moved back to the Nazareth Motherhouse in Concordia, where she died\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nARNOLDY - 2\n\ntwo years later, in 1985.

July 4, 1899\u2013July 22, 1987.\nUniversity of Kansas (BA 1920), University of Chicago (MA 1926, PhD 1930).\n\nBeatrice Liberty Hagen was the youngest child of Lena (Sessler) (1865\u20131948),\noriginally from Illinois, and Louis Hagen, born in Wisconsin in 1857. She was born\nin Barton County, near Ellinwood, in central Kansas, where her father was a farmer.\nIn the 1900 census it was reported that her parents had been married sixteen years\nand that there were four children living of \ufb01ve born. They were Bertha (1884\u20131973),\nCharles (1890\u20131951), Maude (1892\u20131974), and Beatrice. All were born in Kansas.\nBeatrice Hagen received her elementary and secondary education in public schools\nand graduated from Ellinwood High School in 1916. She then attended the Univer-\nsity of Kansas, where Wealthy Babcock was one year ahead of her; Florence Black\nwas an instructor and graduate student during Hagen\u2019s \ufb01nal two years at Kansas.\nAfter receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1920, she taught in Kansas high schools;\nshe was in Burlington 1920\u201322 and in Dodge City 1923\u201324.\n\nIn 1924 Hagen entered the University of Chicago, where she studied for the next\ntwo years and received her master\u2019s degree in 1926, having written a thesis with\nE. P. Lane. She then taught at Ozark Wesleyan College in Carthage, Missouri, in\n1926\u201327. Ozark Wesleyan had opened the previous year and closed in 1932. She also\ntaught at Nebraska State Normal College (now Chadron State College) in Chadron\n1928\u201329. After further study at Chicago and completing a dissertation in projective\ndi\ufb00erential geometry directed by Lane, she received her PhD in 1930.\n\nHagen\u2019s \ufb01rst position after her degree was at Fort Hays Kansas State College\n(now Fort Hays State University) 1930\u201331. In 1931 she took a position as instruc-\ntor at Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University), where she\nremained until her retirement in 1959. She was promoted to assistant professor in\n1940, to associate professor in 1945, and to professor in 1956, three years before\nher retirement. Among her female colleagues at Penn State were Helen Brewster\nOwens, Teresa Cohen, Aline Huke Frink, and Ethel Moody. It appears that in the\nlate 1940s Hagen gave a speech on women in astronomy to the local chapter of\nSigma Delta Epsilon (now Sigma Delta Epsilon-Graduate Women in Science) at\nPenn State. The text of her talk appears in the Owens Papers.\n\nHagen was appointed a temporary associate professor at Kansas State University\nin Manhattan after her retirement from Penn State and taught there 1960\u201362. In\n1964 she moved to Great Bend, Kansas, where she made a home with her two\nsisters, Bertha and Maude. Bertha had remained in the area, cared for her parents,\nand helped with the family farm. Maude, who attended the University of Kansas,\nwas a French teacher in Hiawatha, Kansas; she moved to Great Bend after her\nretirement. Both Beatrice and Maude did tutoring after retiring. Beatrice Hagen\nwas a member of the Sunshine Club in Ellinwood, about ten miles from Great Bend,\nand was a Presbyterian. In 1940 she described herself as a Republican.\n\nIn a February 14, 1978, letter to one of the authors, Beatrice Hagen reported\nthat \u201cwomen were quite frankly advised not to enter the higher \ufb01elds of mathe-\nmatics, physics and chemistry because there was di\ufb03culty in obtaining satisfactory\npositions.\u201d She also noted that \u201cWorld War II and committee work \ufb01lled my time,\nplus the feeling that what I did in the line of research was not very important made\nmost of my \u2018playthings\u2019 go unpublished.

March 7, 1893\u2013August 24, 1975.\nGoucher College (BA 1915), University of Pennsylvania (MA 1919, PhD 1922).\n\nAnna Margaret Mullikin was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the youngest of four\nchildren of Sophia Ridgely (Battee) (1854\u20131921) and William Lawrence Mullikin\n(1846\u20131915), both natives of Maryland. William Mullikin\u2019s occupation was listed\nas leather hider in 1900, and at that time the household consisted of his wife,\nhis mother-in-law, his sister-in-law, the four children, and a cook. In 1910 William\nMullikin\u2019s occupation was listed as leather dealer. The Mullikin children were Mary\nHester (b. 1884), Richard Nicholas (b. 1888), Caroline Battee (1890\u20131969), and\nAnna, who later used the name Anne. All of the Mullikin daughters graduated\nfrom Goucher College and became public high school teachers. The son earned a\nPhD in chemistry and worked in industry.\n\nAfter graduating from Goucher College in 1915, Mullikin taught in private schools\nfor three years. She was at Science Hill School in Shelbyville, Kentucky, 1915\u201317 and\nwas an instructor at Mary Baldwin Seminary in Staunton, Virginia, 1917\u201318. She\nentered the University of Pennsylvania with a university scholarship in mathemat-\nics for 1918\u201319 and received her master\u2019s degree at the end of the academic year.\nThe next year she continued her work at the University of Pennsylvania, and at\nthe same time she taught at the Stevens School in the Germantown neighborhood\nof Philadelphia.\n\nMullikin worked in topology with R. L. Moore, who had been at Pennsylvania\nsince 1911. Having done his undergraduate work at the University of Texas, Moore\nreturned to Texas in the fall of 1920. He was clearly interested in having Mullikin\nat Texas, and in the spring of 1920, during negotiations with the department there,\nMoore wrote that he hoped Texas would o\ufb00er her an instructorship. In an earlier\nletter, he had described her as \u201cone of the best students I ever had\u201d (Lewis, \u201cThe\nBuilding of the University of Texas Mathematics Faculty,\u201d 228). Thus, Mullikin\nspent the year 1920\u201321 as instructor at Texas. The following year she returned to\nstudy at the University of Pennsylvania and simultaneously taught at the Oak Lane\nCountry Day School. Even though Moore remained at Texas, he was advisor for\nMullikin\u2019s dissertation culminating in her doctorate from Pennsylvania in 1922.\n\nMullikin\u2019s dissertation was an important work in topology, and her main result\nwas often referred to as \u201cMiss Mullikin\u2019s theorem.\u201d In a 1924 paper in the Polish\njournal Fundamenta Mathematicae, R. L. Moore noted that \u201ca proposition which is\na logical consequence of . . . theorems of Janiszewski\u2019s has been recently established\nby Miss Anna M. Mullikin in her Doctor\u2019s dissertation, which will appear soon in\nthe Transactions of the American Mathematical Society. This paper had gone to\nthe printers before either Miss Mullikin or I was aware that the proposition had\nalready been proved. Apparently Janiszewski\u2019s paper is printed in Polish\u201d (6:190fn).\nZygmunt Janiszewski\u2019s paper appeared in 1913 and he died in early 1920. Mullikin\u2019s\npaper appeared in 1922, and Moore learned of Janiszewski\u2019s results from a 1923\npaper by Stefan Straszewicz. By 1928, American mathematicians had begun to call\nthe result the \u201cJaniszewski-Mullikin theorem\u201d; in the many citations to her work\nthat have appeared through at least the 1980s, both names of the theorem appear.\nThomas Bartlow and David Zitarelli discuss the mathematics in great detail in\n\u201cWho Was Miss Mullikin?\u201d in the American Mathematical Monthly (forthcoming).\nIn 1988 Mary Ellen Rudin, one of Moore\u2019s most well-known students, described\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMULLIKIN - 2\n\nMullikin\u2019s thesis as \u201cfantastic\u201d (Albers, Reid, and Rudin, \u201cAn Interview with Mary\nEllen Rudin,\u201d 123).\n\nAfter receiving her PhD, Mullikin became a high school teacher. She taught at\nWilliam Penn High School in Philadelphia the academic year 1922\u201323 and moved\nto Germantown High School, also in Philadelphia, in 1923. She was a teacher at\nGermantown High School and became head of the mathematics department in 1952.\nShe remained there until her retirement in 1959. In 1954 Goucher College honored\nMullikin with an alumnae achievement citation. During the late 1950s and early\n1960s she coauthored textbooks with Ethel L. Grove, who had been at Cuyahoga\nHeights High School in Cleveland, and Ewart L. Grove of the University of Alabama.\nWhile at Germantown High School, Mullikin taught a future (1952) R. L. Moore\nstudent, Mary-Elizabeth Hamstrom. In 1998 Hamstrom wrote to one of the authors\nthat Mullikin\u2019s \u201cinterest in me was very important.\u201d The two became friends, and\nMullikin gave Hamstrom her \u201c\ufb01rst dog as a high school graduation present.\u201d Mul-\nlikin told her that she had chosen high school teaching because research was harder\nand the money was not as good. In 1930 Mullikin is listed as a Republican and\nan Episcopalian. In 1956 she endowed the Julia Morgan Fund at the First United\nMethodist Church of Germantown. Mullikin and Morgan had become friends when\nboth were studying at the University of Pennsylvania. Julia Morgan became a\nMethodist medical missionary in China before returning to the United States and\nsubsequently teaching medicine at the University of Pennsylvania in Philadelphia.\nAnna Mullikin was residing in Philadelphia at the time of her death at age\neighty-two in 1975. She was survived by two nieces and a nephew and was interred\nin Mt.

August 7, 1869\u2013December 5, 1959.\nUniversity of Wisconsin (BA 1889), Georg-August-Universit\u00a8at G\u00a8ottingen (PhD\n1897).\n\nMary Frances Winston was born in Forreston, Illinois, the fourth of eight chil-\ndren of Caroline Eliza (Mumford) (1836\u20131909), who was born in Pennsylvania,\nand Thomas Winston (1829\u20131928), who was born in Wales and immigrated to the\nUnited States when he was two years old. Mary Winston\u2019s parents married in Illi-\nnois in December 1861. Her father was a physician trained in a six-week course at\nRush Medical School in Chicago, and her mother, who had taught French, art, and\nmathematics at various schools in the East and in Illinois, prepared the children\nfor college. Her mother learned geology though a correspondence course with the\nField Museum in Chicago and learned Greek on her own in order to teach it to\nher children. Winston\u2019s father, who had served in the Union army as a surgeon\nduring the Civil War, had taken advantage of the government\u2019s o\ufb00er to sell land\nto former o\ufb03cers and bought about 3000 acres, mostly in Nebraska, some of which\nhe would sell when his income was not su\ufb03cient to pay for his children\u2019s college\ntuition. The family lived in Forreston, in northern Illinois, until 1892 when they\nmoved to Chicago.\n\nWinston\u2019s older siblings were Edward Mumford (1862\u20131948), Thomas Win\ufb01eld\n(1865\u20131926), and Ambrose Par\u00b4e (1867\u20131959). Her younger siblings were Eugenia\n(1871\u20131956), Milton (1873\u201374), Charles Sumner (1876\u20131928), and Alice (1878\u2013\n1943). Edward, the eldest child, graduated from Harvard in 1884, received an\nLLB degree from Wisconsin in 1888, and became a lawyer who was in business\nin Chicago. Win\ufb01eld was a graduate of the US Military Academy at West Point\nand was in the army at the Presidio in 1893\u201395, where he guarded the Southern\nPaci\ufb01c Railway during the 1894 railroad strikes. He indicated then that he expected\nto take the bar exam. It appears that he made a career in the military; in 1910 he\nwas an army o\ufb03cer living with has wife and \ufb01ve children in Virginia. Ambrose Par\u00b4e\nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree from Wisconsin in 1887 and studied at Johns Hopkins\nUniversity and the University of Chicago before earning a PhD in political science\nin 1900 at Cornell University. He specialized in political economy and was later a\nprofessor of economics at the University of Texas in Austin. Eugenia received a BA\nfrom Wisconsin in 1890. During most of the 1890s the younger siblings, Eugenia,\nCharles, and Alice, all lived at home, and all did some studies at the University of\nChicago. Charles and Alice earned bachelor\u2019s degrees in 1896 and 1898, respectively;\nand Eugenia and Alice earned master\u2019s degrees in 1897 and 1903, respectively. Eu-\ngenia was a teacher before her marriage; Charles became an engineer; and Alice\ntaught English at the University of Kansas starting in 1909.\n\nIn 1884 Mary Frances Winston, known to her family and friends as May, and her\nolder brother Par\u00b4e enrolled at the University of Wisconsin in Madison, eighty-\ufb01ve\nmiles from Forreston. She interrupted her studies to teach one year in a country\nschool before returning to Wisconsin and graduating in 1889 with honors in math-\nematics. During at least her last year at Wisconsin, her younger sister Eugenia\nwas also enrolled there, and both were members of one of the two campus ladies\u2019\nliterary societies. Mary Winston wrote a senior thesis on \u201cIntegrating factors of\ndi\ufb00erential equations\u201d and wanted to attend graduate school at Wisconsin. She\nwas denied a fellowship, and so in 1889 she accepted a job teaching mathematics\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nNEWSON - 2\n\nat Wisconsin Female College in Fox Lake. That year the name of the college was\nchanged to Downer College; in 1895 it took over the campus of Milwaukee College\nand changed its name to Milwaukee-Downer College. Her \ufb01rst year she applied to\nthe mathematics program at Bryn Mawr College but was turned down for a fel-\nlowship, which was given instead to Ruth Gentry. However, when Gentry received\na European fellowship from the Association for Collegiate Alumnae (ACA) for the\nfollowing year, Scott telegraphed Winston to suggest she apply again. This time\nWinston was successful, and in 1891\u201392 she was a graduate fellow at Bryn Mawr\nwhere she studied with Scott and James Harkness. At the end of her year in Eu-\nrope, Gentry returned to Bryn Mawr and its fellowship. Despite Scott\u2019s urging her\nto stay, Winston left because she could not a\ufb00ord a year without \ufb01nancial support.\nSince her family was moving to Chicago, Winston applied for a fellowship at\nthe newly opened University of Chicago. Although she was awarded only an hon-\norary fellowship that paid her tuition, it was su\ufb03cient since she could live with\nher parents. At Chicago, Winston took courses from E. H. Moore, Oskar Bolza,\nand Heinrich Maschke. They encouraged her to stay at Chicago but she wanted\nto study in Germany, and in the spring of 1893, with their recommendations, she\napplied for the ACA European fellowship. She did not receive the fellowship, but in\nlate August 1893 she met with Felix Klein of G\u00a8ottingen who was in Chicago as the\nrepresentative of German mathematics at the International Mathematical Congress\nheld in connection with the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition. He encouraged her to\ncome to G\u00a8ottingen to study, although he could not promise her admission there.\nChristine Ladd Franklin, who had previously corresponded with Klein about the\nadmission of women to G\u00a8ottingen, heard of Winston\u2019s desire to study in Germany\nand sent her $500 to help \ufb01nance her \ufb01rst year there. The following week Winston\nreceived an o\ufb00er to teach at Vassar College, which she turned down.\n\nAt the end of September 1893 Mary Frances Winston sailed on the S. S. Wester-\nland with Ida Hyde, the biologist who had received the ACA European fellowship.\nMuch of the information about Winston\u2019s experiences in Europe comes from letters\nto her family that were transcribed by her daughter, Caroline Beshers, who gave\ncopies of the transcriptions to one of the authors. The letters and transcriptions\nare now in the Sophia Smith Collection at Smith College.\n\nBy mid-October 1893 Winston had met with Klein, who told her to write a\npetition for admission and informed her that she could attend lectures while waiting\nfor a response. She also met Grace Chisholm and Margaret Maltby, two women who\nhad also come to G\u00a8ottingen to try to enroll: Chisholm in mathematics, Maltby in\nphysics. Upon \ufb01rst meeting Chisholm, May Winston wrote to her brother Charley\nOctober 17, 1893, \u201cWe are to have nearly the same work and I think we will work\ntogether a good deal. It is an opportunity which I have never enjoyed before\u2013to work\nwith someone who is my equal\u2013or nearly so\u2013for I do not consider her very much\nahead of me.\u201d By December of that year Winston had realized that Chisholm\u2019s\nEnglish mathematical education was more extensive than her own and realized\nthat she would not get her degree as quickly as Chisholm would.\n\nBy the end of October 1893, Winston, Chisholm, and Maltby were all informed\nthat their petitions had been accepted \u201causnahm weise (as an exception).\u201d That\nsame week, Winston attended her \ufb01rst lectures: Klein\u2019s on hypergeometric series\nand Heinrich Weber\u2019s on function theory and on theory of algebraic numbers. She\nalso expected to attend both Klein\u2019s and Weber\u2019s seminaries and expected to stop\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nNEWSON - 3\n\nattending one of Weber\u2019s courses. On December 20, 1893, Winston became the \ufb01rst\nwoman to give a Vortrag (read a paper) at the university at G\u00a8ottingen when she\noutlined a paper that had appeared in the Mathematische Annalen.\n\nWinston remained in Europe, studying at G\u00a8ottingen and occasionally traveling.\nShe and Chisholm were close friends and \u201cthey called one another Julius and Pom-\npey, [presumably] because they had crossed the Rhine to victory\u201d (Caroline Beshers\nto one of the authors, February 24, 1977). Winston decided against applying for\nthe ACA European fellowship for her second year since she had not done any orig-\ninal research by the time the application was due. Her family supported her during\n1894\u201395. Winston\u2019s \ufb01rst original work was done during the summer of 1894 and\nappeared in the Mathematische Annalen in 1895. With that paper she was able\nto secure the ACA fellowship for 1895\u201396, her third and \ufb01nal year at G\u00a8ottingen.\nHer dissertation, written under Klein\u2019s supervision, was completed by the middle\nof that year, and she passed her examination in July 1896. Winston received her\nPhD magna cum laude in 1897 after \ufb01nally \ufb01nding a publisher for her dissertation\nin Germany. Chisholm and Maltby had both received their PhD\u2019s in 1895, and so\nWinston was the second woman, and the \ufb01rst American woman, to receive a doc-\ntorate in mathematics from G\u00a8ottingen as an enrolled student; So\ufb01a Kovalevskaya\nhad received a PhD from G\u00a8ottingen in 1874 but had never attended classes there.\nWhile in G\u00a8ottingen May Winston was part of an American community that\nincluded many students of mathematics. She met and became friends with An-\nnie MacKinnon (Fitch), who was the ACA European fellow for the year 1894\u201395.\nTwo other mathematicians who had been at Cornell University and were study-\ning at G\u00a8ottingen during this time were Virgil Snyder, who received his PhD from\nG\u00a8ottingen in 1895, and J. H. Tanner. Both returned to Cornell and spent the re-\nmainder of their careers there. In March 1897 Tanner wrote to the University of\nMinnesota that Winston \u201cimpressed me as an unusually strong mathematician; I\nshould place her certainly in the \ufb01rst group of half a dozen women mathematicians\nin this century. Few of our people, whether men or women, have had so good a\ntraining as has this young women, added to this she has an especially good mathe-\nmatical mind. She has thoroughly saturated herself with the spirit of modern ideas\nin mathematics\u201d (private collection).\n\nWinston returned to the United States in 1896 without a job, but at the begin-\nning of September she found a position for the year 1896\u201397 teaching at St. Joseph\nHigh School in St. Joseph, Missouri. In December 1896 she read a paper at a con-\nference held in Chicago; the conference, which had been called by local members\nof the AMS, adopted a resolution that resulted in the formation of the Chicago\nSection of the AMS. In 1897 Winston was appointed professor of mathematics at\nKansas State Agricultural College (now Kansas State University) in Manhattan.\nSoon after her appointment, H. B. Newson of the mathematics department of the\nUniversity of Kansas wrote a review of her dissertation stating: \u201cThis publication\nby Miss Winston . . . is in all respects worthy of that lady\u2019s reputation as a math-\nematician. . . . Although this work was written before its author became a Kansan,\nit re\ufb02ects credit upon the state and the state institution which she represents\u201d\n(Kansas Univ. Quart. 7 (1898): 40).\n\nWinston stayed at Kansas State for three years before resigning in order to\nmarry Henry Byron Newson on July 21, 1900. H. B. Newson was born July 10,\n1860, in Mt. Gilead, Ohio, and was educated at Ohio Wesleyan University (which\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nNEWSON - 4\n\nlater conferred an honorary doctorate on him) and at Johns Hopkins University. He\nalso studied in Heidelberg and with Sophus Lie 1887\u201388 in Leipzig. Newson taught\nat Central Tennessee College 1884\u201386 and at Western Normal College in Bushell,\nIllinois, 1888\u201390 before going to the University of Kansas in 1890. At the University\nof Kansas, nepotism regulations prevented Mary Winston Newson from teaching\nduring the year, but she was able to teach during the summers. Also during this\nperiod, with David Hilbert\u2019s permission, she translated his famous \u201cMathematical\nProblems\u201d paper for the Bulletin of the AMS.\n\nThe Newsons had three children: Caroline (1901\u20131998), Josephine (1903\u20131994),\nand Henry Winston (1909\u20131978). Her eldest daughter, Caroline Newson Beshers,\nlater reported in a letter to one of the authors that Henry B. Newson \u201cwas trying\nvery hard to encourage [May] to be a mathematician. May\u2019s mother wrote her\nurging that she set aside a few hours every day for study, as she herself had done,\nand she also wrote Henry encouraging him to encourage [May]\u201d (August 3, 1977).\nIn Lawrence, Mary W. Newson became friends with Helen Brewster (Owens), who\nearned her master\u2019s degree in 1901 under the supervision of H. B. Newson. In 1937\nOwens organized a luncheon to honor women pioneers in mathematics, and Newson\nwas one of the honored guests.\n\nOn the night of February 17, 1910, Henry Byron Newson died in his sleep. Not\nyet \ufb01fty, he had been unable to purchase life insurance because of a bad heart\nand had taught only nineteen and a half years of the twenty years required in\norder for his widow to receive payments from his retirement pension. Thus, Mary\nW. Newson was left with only the income from two houses they rented, an income\ninsu\ufb03cient to support her and her three children. Although the University of Kansas\nmathematics department hired three new faculty members that year, including\nMarion Ballantyne White, they could not have hired Newson because her sister\nAlice Winston had just accepted a position in the English department. When the\n1910 census was enumerated in April, Mary Newson, her three small children, and a\nsister-in-law were listed together. Mary Newson\u2019s recently widowed father, her late\nmother\u2019s sister, her sister Alice, and a housekeeper were also living in Lawrence; the\nlatter were still living there in January 1920. Newson remained in Lawrence for a\nfew years after her husband\u2019s death. During that period she and Helen Owens, who\nhad returned from New York to Kansas to work on the 1911\u201312 su\ufb00rage campaign,\nhelped produce a Votes for Women Pageant there.\n\nIn 1913 Newson accepted a job as an assistant professor at Washburn College in\nTopeka, Kansas, close enough so that she could come back to Lawrence to spend\nweekends with her children, who were at \ufb01rst living at her father\u2019s house. In 1915\nonly the youngest child was enumerated with Mary Newson\u2019s father, aunt, and sister\nin Lawrence. While at Washburn, Newson joined the MAA as a charter member and\nwas one of the \ufb01fteen original members of the Kansas Section. She often attended\nthe Kansas Section meetings, leading a discussion on a paper of J. N. Van der Vries\none year and presenting a paper of her own another year. She was also active in the\nKansas Association of Teachers of Mathematics, serving as its chairman in 1915.\nShe was an assistant professor when she left Washburn College at the end of the\n1920\u201321 academic year.\n\nIn 1921 Newson became head of the department of mathematics at Eureka Col-\nlege in Eureka, Illinois. During the spring of 1921 she had been looking actively\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nNEWSON - 5\n\nfor a new position, applying at least to Eureka, the University of Texas, and Mon-\ntana State. Her son later reported that she was o\ufb00ered a position at Texas, but\nthat it was withdrawn because her brother was a professor of economics there. Her\ndaughter Caroline reported that she wanted to leave Washburn because she was\n\u201cdissatis\ufb01ed with her subordinate position under a man with much less knowledge\u201d\n(letter to author February 24, 1977). In addition, Newson had signed a petition\nsupporting a faculty member, Dr. Kirkpatrick, who had been \ufb01red for expressing\nhis political opinions to students. The incident was investigated by the AAUP at\nthe time. All those who signed the petition left Washburn within a few years.\n\nNewson remained at Eureka the rest of her career. She taught courses in both\nmathematics and astronomy and shared the leadership of a combined mathemat-\nics and science division from 1928 until 1934 when she became chairman of that\ndivision. She was forced to retire from full-time teaching in 1937 when the college\ninstituted a mandatory retirement policy. She continued teaching part time and re-\nmained chair of the division another two years. Newson \ufb01nally retired from teaching\nat the end of the 1941\u201342 academic year.\n\nAt Eureka, Newson was active in the Illinois Section of the MAA and was par-\nticularly active in the AAUW. She was instrumental in the founding of the local\nchapter of AAUW and served as chairman of the International Relations Round\nTable of the Eureka branch of the AAUW from 1928 until 1938. In 1940 Newson\nwas honored by the Women\u2019s Centennial Congress as one of one hundred women\nwho held positions that were not open to them a hundred years earlier. Her daugh-\nter later reported that \u201cit was characteristic of her that when a reporter called the\ncollege no one there knew she had received the invitation. She had declined because\nthe dinner came on the same day as her \ufb01rst classes of that semester\u201d (letter to\nauthor February 24, 1977). The local paper, The Daily Pantograph in Blooming-\nton, Illinois, quoted her as saying, \u201cThe trip is out. In my 33 years of teaching,\nI\u2019ve always opened my classes on the \ufb01rst day. Any professor knows that he should\nintroduce his own work himself.\u201d Instead the Eureka chapter of the AAUW and\nthe local international relations group, two groups with which Newson was involved\nfrom the start, honored her with a dinner in April 1941.\n\nIn 1913 the University of Wisconsin elected Newson as an alumni member of Phi\nBeta Kappa. She was a long-standing member of AAUW, having attended meetings\nas early as her student days at the University of Chicago when it was still the ACA.\nShe was also a member of the Women\u2019s Christian Temperance Union, was raised a\nUnitarian and kept that a\ufb03liation as an adult, and in 1914 reported that she was\na political independent.\n\nAfter her retirement Newson moved to Lake Dalecarlia in Lowell, Indiana, where\nshe had previously spent vacations. In 1956 she moved to a nursing home in\nPoolesville, Maryland, near where her daughter Caroline Beshers lived. She died\nat the nursing home at age ninety and was buried in Lawrence, Kansas. In 1977\nCaroline Beshers wrote that her \u201cmother was probably the most modest and unas-\nsuming person alive\u201d but that she had \u201chad the energy and courage to face up to\nKaiser Wilhem II and to win, Magna cum Laude.\u201d\n\nAfter Newson\u2019s death her children endowed a Mary Newson lecture series on\ninternational relations at Eureka College. In March 2007 Newson was named one of\nEureka College\u2019s \u201cMatrons of Distinction\u201d; in connection with that honor she was\ndescribed on the web page for March 3rd as \u201ca champion of academic freedom, of\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nNEWSON - 6\n\nthe centrality of international studies to the liberal arts, and of the belief that one\nindividual can (and must) make a di\ufb00erence, even in spite of overwhelming odds.\u201d\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, AAUW, Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nDissertation:\n1897 [Winston, M.

      "text": "FITCH, Annie (MacKinnon). June 1, 1868\u2013September 12, 1940.\nUniversity of Kansas (BS 1889, MS 1891), Cornell University (PhD 1894).\n\nAnnie Louise MacKinnon was born in Woodstock, Ontario, Canada, the daugh-\nter of Annie Louise (Gilbert) (1834\u2013ca. 1919), and Malcolm MacKinnon (1838\u2013ca.\n1903), natives of Ontario. The family was living in Kansas by 1870, and according\nto census records from 1870 and 1880, there were at least \ufb01ve children. They were\nGilbert J., age \ufb01ve in 1870 but not listed in the 1880 census; Annie; Malcolm, an\ninfant in 1870 and ten in 1880; Frederick B., age eight in 1880; and D. Stanley,\nage one in 1880. In 1870 her father was a real estate agent, and in 1880 he was\na hardware merchant. She lived in Concordia, Kansas, during her childhood and\ngraduated from Concordia High School.\n\nMacKinnon then enrolled at the University of Kansas in Lawrence and was\none of the \ufb01rst two women in our study to graduate from a public university.\nThe University of Kansas opened in 1866 with about \ufb01fty students, roughly half\nmen and half women, although the \ufb01rst degree was not awarded until 1873. It\nappears that after her graduation in 1889, MacKinnon began her graduate work in\nmathematics at Kansas. According to Price\u2019s history of the Kansas mathematics\ndepartment, she was the third graduate student in mathematics in the university\u2019s\nhistory. MacKinnon also taught in the high school in Lawrence 1890\u201392 and received\nher master\u2019s degree in 1891. In 1891\u201392, she continued her studies at the University\nof Kansas with Henry Byron Newson, a research mathematician who had been\nappointed to the faculty a year earlier.\n\nMacKinnon enrolled at Cornell University in October 1892 and was Erastus\nBrooks fellow her last year there, 1893\u201394. It was noted that she had previously\ncompleted non-resident graduate work in modern geometry. She received her PhD\nfrom Cornell in 1894 with major subject theory of functions, \ufb01rst minor quantics\nand statics, and second minor mathematical physics.\n\nAnnie MacKinnon spent the next two years studying mathematics at G\u00a8ottingen,\nas Association of Collegiate Alumnae European fellow in 1894\u201395 and as Women\u2019s\nEducation Association of Boston European fellow in 1895\u201396. Also at G\u00a8ottingen\nduring this period were Mary Frances Winston, later to marry Henry Byron New-\nson; John H. Tanner, an assistant professor of mathematics from Cornell; and Ed-\nward Fitch, an assistant professor of Greek at Hamilton College whom MacKinnon\nlater married.\n\nAfter returning from G\u00a8ottingen in 1896, MacKinnon was appointed the professor\nof mathematics at Wells College, a small college for women in Aurora, New York,\nthat awarded its \ufb01rst degree in 1869. In addition to being the only mathemat-\nics instructor, teaching courses through di\ufb00erential equations, she was registrar in\n1900\u201301. She remained at Wells until 1901, when on July 3, in Lakeside, Ohio, she\nmarried Edward Fitch (1864\u20131946). MacKinnon\u2019s replacement at Wells was Anna\nLavinia Van Benschoten, who would subsequently earn her doctorate from Cornell.\nEdward Fitch was born in Alton, New York, and received his BA in 1886 and his\nMA in 1889 in Greek from Hamilton College, a school for men in Clinton, New York.\nHe went to G\u00a8ottingen in 1893 and studied under the eminent classical philologist\nUlrich von Wilamowitz-Moellendor\ufb00. Fitch received his PhD in 1896, Wilamowitz\u2019s\nonly American doctoral student. Like MacKinnon, Fitch returned that year from\nG\u00a8ottingen to New York State. He resumed his position teaching Greek at Hamilton\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nFITCH - 2\n\nCollege, which was nearly a hundred miles from Wells College. Edward Fitch spent\nthe rest of his career at Hamilton, where he was promoted to associate professor in\n1899 and was named Edward North Professor of Greek in 1904. He was dean 1926\u2013\n32 and spent the following year as a professor at the American School of Classical\nStudies at Athens. He retired in 1934 as professor and dean emeritus. They had no\nchildren.\n\nAnnie Fitch was a member of the League of Women Voters and was on the\nbook committee of a nearby town library. In the late 1920s, she reported to the\nAAUW that \u201cafter [her] marriage [she] continued upon mathematical investigations\nstarted some years before\u201d (Maltby, 16). She was a charter member of the MAA\nand maintained that membership until her death at age seventy-two. She died at\nher home in Clinton, New York, after a long illness, having written to Helen Owens\nin May 1940, a few months before her death: \u201cIt seems to me worthwhile that some\nwomen are intelligent about things mathematical even if their own accomplishments\nare not great\u201d (Owens Papers).\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA (charter member), AAAS, Phi Beta Kappa,\nSigma Xi.\n\nDissertation:\n1894 [MacKinnon, A.

October 22, 1900\u2013February 18, 1999.\nMount Holyoke College (BA 1922), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1930).\n\nRose Lucile Anderson was born in Jamestown, New York, the second of three\nchildren of Anna (Ebel), born in Germany in 1870, and Charles J. Anderson, born in\nSweden in 1867. Her father immigrated to the United States in 1868, her mother in\n1873. Both were later naturalized. Her father was the proprietor of a machine shop.\nHer older sister, Ethel Louise (1897\u20131983), graduated from Mount Holyoke College\nin 1919, received a master\u2019s degree from Cornell University in 1920, and taught\nzoology at the University of Kentucky for about two years before her marriage to\nLester S. O\u2019Bannon of the mechanical engineering department. She was living in\nTexas at the time of her death. A younger brother, Charles J. Jr., was born in\nabout 1906, attended Cornell, and died in his thirties.\n\nR. Lucile Anderson attended Jamestown public schools including the Jamestown\nhigh school from which she graduated in 1918. She immediately entered Mount\nHolyoke College and graduated in 1922 with senior honors in mathematics. Ander-\nson went directly to Bryn Mawr College for graduate work in mathematics. She\nwas a graduate scholar in mathematics 1922\u201323, a resident fellow 1923\u201324, and a\nfellow by courtesy and holder of the \u201986 fellowship from Mount Holyoke 1924\u201325.\nIn the spring of 1924 she was awarded the Mary E. Garrett European fellowship\nfrom Bryn Mawr, which she used for study at Cambridge University in England in\n1925\u201326.\n\nWhen Anderson returned from England she was hired as instructor of mathe-\nmatics at the University of Rochester, where she remained for two years, 1926\u201328.\nIn 1928 she began her long association with Hunter College. The following year,\n1929\u201330, she was a graduate student and part-time instructor at Bryn Mawr Col-\nlege, where she completed her work for the PhD with a dissertation in analysis\nwritten under the direction of Anna Pell Wheeler and with a minor in physics.\n\nIn 1930 Anderson returned to Hunter, again as instructor until 1936, as assistant\nprofessor 1936\u201356, and as associate professor 1956\u201371. Starting in the mid-1950s\nshe taught graduate courses and from 1964 served as advisor in the teacher ed-\nucation program. In a letter written in 1972 for the 50th reunion booklet of the\nMount Holyoke Class of 1922 Anderson reported, \u201cI retired in 1971 after teaching\nmathematics at Hunter College of the City of New York for more years than I care\nto admit. The years have been spiced with some travel \u2013 Mexico, Alaska, Europe;\nsome sports \u2013 golf, hiking, \ufb01gure skating; some theater when tickets can be ob-\ntained without too much e\ufb00ort. For the present, I still have an apartment in New\nYork and no immediate plans for moving into a \u2018retirement community\u2019 \u201d (Mount\nHolyoke College Archives).\n\nAnderson was still living in her apartment on East 54th Street in New York\nCity when she died at age ninety-eight in 1999. She was survived by \ufb01ve nieces and\nnephews and eighteen great-nieces and great-nephews. She was cremated and her\nashes returned to her hometown of Jamestown, New York, where she had spent\nmany of her summers.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, AAUP.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nANDERSON, R.

      "text": "GURNEY, Margaret. October 28, 1908\u2013March 19, 2002.\nSwarthmore College (BA 1930), Brown University (MA 1931, PhD 1934).\n\nMargaret Gurney was the eldest of three children of Anna Elizabeth (Pickett)\n(1885\u20131966) and Dayton Alvin Gurney (1883\u20131965), both natives of Michigan. Her\nparents both graduated from the State Agricultural College in Michigan (now Michi-\ngan State University); her mother received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1905; her father\nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree. Margaret Gurney noted in a\nconversation with one of the authors in 1996 that her mother, who had been good\nin mathematics, had gone to college at age \ufb01fteen and her father at age sixteen. Her\nparents married on September 7, 1907, and Margaret was born just over a year later\nin Washington, D.C. Her siblings, John O. (1911\u20131992) and Ruth H. (1913\u20131995),\nwere also born there while her father was an engineer in the US War Department.\nHe later became chief engineer in the Ordnance O\ufb03ce. Margaret Gurney\u2019s brother\nreceived a BS degree from the University of Michigan in 1933 and became a mechan-\nical engineer with the US Department of Defense; her sister attended the University\nof Maryland and El Camino College in California, married, and had a family.\n\nMargaret Gurney attended public schools and graduated from Central High\nSchool in Washington, D.C., in 1926. She held a White open scholarship for women\nat Swarthmore College 1926\u201330 and graduated with highest honors in mathemat-\nics, physics, and astronomy in 1930. In the 1996 conversation, Gurney, who had\nplanned to be a Latin major, credited Arnold Dresden at Swarthmore with being\nan inspiration for her in mathematics. Gurney studied at Brown University, where\nshe was a University junior fellow 1930\u201331, earned her master\u2019s degree in 1931, and\ncontinued her graduate studies as a Joshua Lippincott fellow from Swarthmore Col-\nlege 1931\u201332. Two articles by Gurney appeared in 1932 dealing with convergence\nand summability in series.\n\nIn 1932\u201333 Gurney studied at the university in G\u00a8ottingen as a Miss Abbott\u2019s\nSchool Alumnae fellow from Pembroke College, Brown University. While there she\nmet Hans Lewy, a privat-docent at G\u00a8ottingen, who had received his doctorate\nthere in 1926. In 1933 Gurney returned to Brown to continue her graduate work.\nLewy also went to Brown at that time. He was a research associate 1933\u201335 before\nmoving to the University of California for the remainder of his career. Gurney\nworked extensively with Lewy as she completed her work for the PhD in 1934 with\na dissertation in partial di\ufb00erential equations directed by J. D. Tamarkin. In 1938\nLewy referred to her unpublished dissertation in an article in the Transactions of\nthe AMS (43:437\u201364).\n\nGurney\u2019s \ufb01rst jobs after receiving her doctorate were as a teacher in girls\u2019\npreparatory schools. She taught at Ogontz School in Ogontz, Pennsylvania, just\nnorthwest of Philadelphia, 1935\u201336, and at Wykeham Rise School in Washington,\nConnecticut, 1936\u201338.\n\nIn 1938 Gurney began her government career, in which she was to work in sta-\ntistics with an emphasis in sampling. She passed her civil service examination in\nstatistics even though she had had no o\ufb03cial statistics courses. She \ufb01rst worked\nfor the US Bureau of the Budget in Washington, D.C., as statistical consultant\n1938\u201340 and as economist 1940\u201344. In 1944 she moved to the US Bureau of the\nCensus, where she was a mathematical statistician until her retirement in about\n1973. Much of her work at the census bureau involved planning and implementing\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGURNEY - 2\n\nsample surveys in demographic and economic \ufb01elds. As part of her job, Gurney\nprogrammed on the \ufb01rst Univac I, which had been built by the Eckert\u2013Mauchly\nComputer Corporation for the Bureau of the Census, and which became operational\nin 1951.\n\nIn addition to her work at the Bureau of the Census, Gurney taught a course in\nsampling theory as a visiting lecturer at Stanford University in 1952 and worked\nmany years as a consultant. She served as a consultant in Puerto Rico for the Bureau\nof Labor Statistics, US Department of Labor, six times in the period 1961\u201371.\nDuring the period 1962\u201376, she was a consultant for the US Agency for International\nDevelopment. She was in Thailand in 1962 and the Dominican Republic in 1963.\nShe gave a workshop in household sample surveys to Latin-American statisticians\nin Mexico City from February to April 1965. She was in Brazil in 1971 and 1976;\nin Kenya, Uganda, and Ethiopia in 1968 and 1970; and in Vietnam in 1972. Much\nof her consulting work dealt with aspects of agricultural census, sampling, and the\ncomputation of reliability.\n\nGurney was much honored for her work at the census bureau. In February 1966\nshe was awarded a US Department of Commerce Silver Medal for \u201cher continuous\ncontributions to the theory and application of sample survey methods over a long\nperiod\u201d (Amer. Statist. 20 no. 2 (1966): 9), and in 1968 she was elected a fellow\nof the American Statistical Association \u201cfor distinguished contributions to the the-\nory of recurrent sample surveys, to the measurement of nonsampling errors, and\nto training programs of foreign statisticians in sample surveys of their own coun-\ntries\u201d (Amer. Statist. 22 no. 4 (1966): 48). Prior to receiving these honors, Gurney\nhad been active in the Washington Statistical Society, a chapter of the American\nStatistical Association (ASA). She served as the secretary-treasurer 1949\u201353 and\nas a representative-at-large to the executive committee 1952\u201353. She was also a\nreferee for the Journal of the ASA and was the Washington correspondent for The\nAmerican Statistician, the news publication of the ASA.\n\nIn the late 1970s Gurney moved to Quilcene, Washington, on the Olympic Penin-\nsula, near her sister. She died in Quilcene in 2002 at age ninety-three, survived by\nnieces and nephews. Her obituary described her as having an \u201cactive spiritual life,\u201d\nhaving attended Episcopal churches in Maryland, in Washington, D.C., and in Port\nTownsend, Washington. It also noted that her pastimes included reading mystery\nnovels, gardening, weaving, knitting, crocheting, and needlepoint, and that she had\nbeen a member of the National Association for Retired Federal Employees, the\nOrder of the Eastern Star, and the local Grange.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, ASA, IMS, Inter-American Statistical Institute, In-\nternational Association of Survey Statisticians, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1931 An introduction to factorial series.

      "text": "LEWIS, Florence P. September 24, 1877\u2013March 10, 1964.\nUniversity of Texas (BA 1897, MA 1898), Radcliffe College (MA 1906), Johns\nHopkins University (PhD 1913).\n\nFlorence Parthenia Lewis was born in Fort Scott, Kansas, the daughter of Mon-\nimia (Chase) (ca. 1851\u20131923) and Walter Felix Lewis (1846\u20131903), who married in\n1872. Her parents were both born in Missouri, and her paternal grandfather was a\njudge of the Supreme Court of Missouri. By the time of the 1900 census her mother\nhad had seven children, six of whom were living. The children were Walter Howard\n(b. 1873), George Chase (b. 1876), Florence Parthenia, Francis Ann (b. 1884), Su-\nsan Elizabeth (1885\u20131967), Walter Felix (b. 1889), and Eugene Grayson (b. 1896).\nThe six youngest were still living in 1900.\n\nLewis attended high school in Austin, Texas, and entered the University of Texas\nas a sophomore with advanced standing in 1894. When she entered she was in the\ngroup leading to a bachelor of literature; her last two years she was in the program\nleading to the bachelor of arts degree. Her \ufb01rst two years at the University of Texas\nshe held the high school scholarship from Austin High School, which was given\nannually to the graduate of each a\ufb03liated high school with the highest standing in\nthe class, and which carried with it exemption from all matriculation or tuition fees.\nLewis graduated from the university in 1897; her obituary states that her degree\nwas in classics. She later noted in her dissertation vita that when she received her\ndegree \u201cDr. G. B. Halsted was professor of mathematics.\u201d In a 1922 obituary of\nHalsted by H. Y. Benedict, excerpted in the Monthly, Lewis is referred to as one of\nHalsted\u2019s \u201cgreat pupils\u201d (29:352).\n\nLewis remained at Texas 1897\u201398 as a graduate student with major subjects\nmathematics, philosophy, and pedagogy. Her master\u2019s degree in 1898 was awarded\nin philosophy. In a letter to E. F. Buchner of January 21, 1911, S. E. Mezes, then\npresident of the University of Texas, described her work as his student during the\nyear 1897\u201398 and noted that she did work in Greek and mathematics that year as\nwell as in philosophy. Of her work in the philosophy courses he wrote that \u201cone\ndealt with the history of Philosophy, and the other was a seminary course of an\nadvanced character and, as nearly as I can remember, dealt with some fundamental\nlogical problems. As to the quality of Miss Lewis\u2019 work, I can speak with certainty.\nNo student I have taught had a better mind or more interest in Philosophy. I am\nnot given to extravagance of statement, but if I were I would employ it with regard\nto her\u201d (student \ufb01les, The Ferdinand Hamburger Archives of the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity).\n\nAfter receiving her master\u2019s degree, Lewis spent the next year, 1898\u201399, as a\nfellow in philosophy at Bryn Mawr College. In 1899\u20131900 she was a traveling fellow\nfrom Bryn Mawr; she studied a half year at the Sorbonne and, during the summer\nquarter, at Z\u00a8urich. Her work that year included lectures and reading on the philos-\nophy of Spinoza by L\u00b4evy-Bruhl, study of Aristotle (in Greek), a Kant seminar, and\nsome lectures on experimental psychology.\n\nAfter Lewis\u2019s return from Europe, it appears that she taught for a year in Mis-\nsissippi. She then returned to the University of Texas where she remained for the\nnext four years. She was listed in the university catalogues as a graduate student\nin mathematics 1901\u201302, a graduate student and a tutor in mathematics 1902\u2013\n03, and a tutor in mathematics 1903\u201305. For 1905\u201306, she was listed as a tutor\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLEWIS - 2\n\nin mathematics, absent on leave. During that year she earned her master\u2019s degree\nin mathematics at Radcli\ufb00e College after which she returned to Texas for a \ufb01nal\nyear as tutor in pure mathematics. As tutor in mathematics, Lewis taught regular\nmathematics courses. For example, her last year at Texas she taught an introductory\nmathematics course that included solid geometry, plane trigonometry, and algebra\nwith an introduction to analytic geometry; she also taught algebra, which included\ntheory of equations, determinants, symmetric functions, and theory of polynomials.\nIn 1907 the trustees of Johns Hopkins University voted to open graduate courses\nto women. In September of that year Clara Latimer Bacon and Florence Parthe-\nnia Lewis both applied for admission to the graduate program in mathematics at\nthe Johns Hopkins University. Bacon, on the faculty at Woman\u2019s College of Balti-\nmore (Goucher College after 1910) since 1897, became in 1911 the \ufb01rst woman to\nbe granted a PhD in mathematics from Johns Hopkins. Lewis began her graduate\nstudies at Johns Hopkins with mathematics as her major and the history of philos-\nophy and psychology as subordinate subjects. She studied full time during 1907\u201308\nand joined Bacon on the faculty at Woman\u2019s College as instructor in the fall of\n1908. Lewis took two courses at Johns Hopkins in 1908\u201309, remained at Woman\u2019s\nCollege, and was again a full-time student at Johns Hopkins during 1911\u201312. In Jan-\nuary 1911 Lewis made application for her PhD. A few days later the committee on\ninstruction in the department of philosophy, psychology, and education accepted\nthe records of advanced work previously done by her at Texas, Byrn Mawr, the\nSorbonne, and Z\u00a8urich. She received her PhD, the second granted to a woman in\nmathematics by Johns Hopkins, in 1913 with a dissertation in algebraic geometry\nwritten under the direction of Frank Morley.\n\nWhen Lewis joined the mathematics faculty at Woman\u2019s College of Baltimore in\n1908, the other faculty members were Bacon and William H. Maltbie. Maltbie, who\nhad earned a law degree, left the following year to practice law. Except for brief\nappointments of instructors, Bacon and Lewis were the mathematics faculty until\nthey were joined in 1925 by Marion M. Torrey, at that time a recent Cornell PhD.\nWhile Bacon and Lewis were on the Goucher mathematics faculty, nine women\ngraduated who later received PhD\u2019s in mathematics, six from Johns Hopkins.\n\nExcept for two leaves of absence, Lewis spent her entire career at Goucher. She\nwas promoted from instructor to assistant professor in 1912, to associate professor\nin 1914, to professor in 1922, and to professor emeritus upon her retirement in\n1947. Lewis spent her second leave of absence in 1918\u201319 at Wellesley College in\nan exchange with Clara E. Smith. She was well respected in the mathematical\ncommunity and served on the council of the AMS 1921\u201323, the \ufb01rst woman since\nCharlotte A. Scott last served at the turn of the century. She also was a member\nof the honorary committee that arranged a meeting in honor of Scott in 1922.\nLewis served as chairman of the Goucher mathematics department from 1931 to\n1943. In addition to teaching mathematics, she was responsible for the founding of\nGoucher\u2019s astronomy program within the mathematics department and maintained\nmemberships in the American Astronomical Society and the Astronomical Society\nof the Paci\ufb01c.

      "text": "WEISS, Marie J. September 21, 1903\u2013August 19, 1952.\nStanford University (BA 1925, PhD 1928), Radcliffe College (MA 1926).\n\nMarie Johanna Weiss was born in Eugene, California, the youngest of three surviving\nchildren of Alice Hedwig (Buschke) and Frederick Weiss. Both parents were born in Ger-\nmany, her mother in 1880 and her father in 1869; they immigrated to the United States in\n1894 and 1884, respectively. At the turn of the century, they had been married three years,\nhad a one-year-old daughter, and were living in Stanislaus County, California, where Fred-\nerick Weiss raised stock. By 1910 the family, with children Hedwig age eleven, Karl age\nnine, and Marie, owned their own farm and were living in Stockton, where they remained\nthroughout Marie\u2019s university years.\n\nMarie J. Weiss attended public grammar and high schools in Stockton, California,\nbefore going to Stanford University in the fall of 1921. While there she was a member of\nRoble Club, which was the women\u2019s dormitory; the German Club, of which she was vice\npresident for two years; the Women\u2019s Education Club, of which she was secretary-treasurer\nher senior year; and the Zoology Club. In the summer of 1924, after her junior year, she\nserved as an assistant in instruction in mathematics. She was elected to Phi Beta Kappa\nand graduated with great distinction in mathematics in 1925, one of eleven receiving BA\u2019s\nin mathematics at Stanford that year, eight of whom were women.\n\nThe following academic year Weiss studied at Radcli\ufb00e College, where she earned her\nmaster\u2019s degree, before returning to Stanford as a graduate student and university fellow\nin mathematics during the two years 1926\u201328. She was again an assistant in instruction\nand taught theory of functions in the summer of 1927. Her dissertation in group theory,\ndirected by W. A. Manning, is dated August 1927. She received her PhD in June 1928. A\npublished version of her dissertation appeared in 1928 and was mentioned in E. T. Bell\u2019s\n1938 survey, \u201cFifty years of algebra in America, 1888\u20131938.\u201d It was one of very few papers\nchosen to \u201cindicate the continued activity of men already in the \ufb01eld in 1907, the enlisting\nof new recruits, and the general nature of the problems considered\u201d by those working in\ngroup theory (p. 13). Weiss was appointed to a National Research Council fellowship in\nmathematics for 1928\u201329 and was reappointed for the following year; she spent both years\nstudying at the University of Chicago.\n\nIn 1930 the mathematics department at H. Sophie Newcomb College, Tulane University,\nunderwent signi\ufb01cant changes: Marie J. Weiss joined the faculty as assistant professor, Nola\nAnderson (Haynes) joined the department as associate professor and chair, and Anna M.\nHowe left Newcomb after eleven years as assistant professor. Weiss remained at Newcomb\nas assistant professor until 1936, except for 1934\u201335, when she was on leave to spend the\nyear at Bryn Mawr College as Emmy Noether scholar and resident scholar in mathematics.\nWeiss was one of four graduate students and post-graduates (the others were Ruth Stau\ufb00er\n(McKee), Grace Shover (Quinn), and Olga Taussky) invited to study with Emmy Noether\nin her second year at Bryn Mawr and what turned out to be the last year of Noether\u2019s\nlife. It was during this year that Weiss began work on a problem on units in \ufb01elds that\nresulted in her 1936 paper.\n\nWeiss returned to Newcomb College for the year 1935\u201336 but left in 1936 to take an\nassistant professorship at Vassar College. After two years at Vassar she returned to New-\ncomb as professor and chair when, in 1938, Nola Anderson left the Newcomb department\nto marry. Weiss remained in those positions the rest of her career there. She turned her\nattention to preparing a highly successful text and to participating in many professional\nactivities in addition to administering the department and teaching at Newcomb. She was\nparticularly active as a member of the MAA. She attended annual meetings regularly after\nreceiving her PhD and was a member of the board of trustees 1937\u201338. She refereed papers\nfor the Monthly from at least 1939 until 1946 and was associate editor 1940\u201346. In that role\nshe was also editor of the Discussion and Notes section 1943\u201346. She was a member of the\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWEISS - 2\n\nCommittee to Review Activities of the MAA 1938\u201340; was a member of the Conference\nCommittee on Education 1941\u201344; and was governor-at-large 1950\u201352. Although not as\nactive in the governance of the AMS, she presented six papers at meetings 1927\u201336, was\nappointed to the nominating committee in 1939, and gave a brief dinner talk at a meeting\nin Chicago the following year. Weiss was also active at the national level in AAUP, serving\non the council 1940\u201342 and as second vice president 1948\u201350.\n\nIn an undated interview in her \ufb01le in the Tulane archives, Weiss remarked on mathe-\nmatics as a \ufb01eld for women. She noted that in the previous year eight women had received\ndoctorates in mathematics in the US and Canada. She said, \u201cMathematics is an open\n\ufb01eld for women but few of the top positions\u2013either in teaching or research\u2013are held by\nwomen. . . . For the woman who desires a chance for a top position in either teaching or\nresearch, the doctorate is a union card. And top positions in either teaching or research\nform what is essentially a \u2018closed shop.\u2019 \u201d\n\nBeginning in about February 1952 Marie Weiss became increasingly ill. While visiting\nher widowed mother and her brother in Visalia, California, in the summer of 1952 the\nillness worsened, and, after six days in the Langley Porter Clinic in San Francisco, Marie\nWeiss died, at age forty-eight, of congestive heart failure as a result of bacterial endocardi-\ntis. Weiss had been a Lutheran and is buried in Stockton, California. The Marie J.

      "text": "PRICE, Irene. January 16, 1902\u2013March 13, 1999.\nIndiana University (BA 1926, MA 1927, PhD 1932).\n\nIrene Price was born in Parr, Indiana, the second of \ufb01ve children of Ruth Eliza-\nbeth (Schroer) (1875\u20131954), originally of Zanesville, Ohio, and William Edward\nPrice (1874\u20131930), born near Rensselaer, Indiana. Her mother attended school\nthrough the eighth grade and her father through about the sixth grade. Her par-\nents, who married September 24, 1899, farmed in northwestern Indiana. Her older\nsister, Lilly (1900\u20131932), \ufb01nished high school and taught for four years before her\nmarriage. Her next younger sister, Gladys (1903\u20131976), completed a master\u2019s de-\ngree and was a biology teacher in Macon, Georgia, until her marriage. Her brother,\nLawson (1908\u20131984), was an electrical engineer and then a farmer before his retire-\nment, while her youngest sister, Esther (1912\u20132006), \ufb01nished high school, married,\nand was a beautician.\n\nIrene Price attended high school in Rensselaer, Indiana, 1915\u201319 before teaching\ngrade school in Rensselaer for the next four years. During the summer of 1921 she\nstudied at Indiana State Normal School (now Indiana State University) in Terre\nHaute.\n\nPrice recalled many years later that she entered Indiana University thinking she\nknew what she wanted to do. \u201cMathematics was always my favorite subject and\nI just intended that eventually teaching high school was my goal, but when I got\nin college I had some very good professors who encouraged me to go on and get\na doctorate\u201d (Smithsonian meeting tapes 1981). She completed the work for her\nbachelor\u2019s degree at Indiana in 1926 and stayed there the next three years for her\ngraduate work in mathematics. She was a part-time instructor at Indiana 1926\u201329,\nwas awarded a Clara Javen Goodbody scholarship in 1927, and was an instructor\nin the extension division 1927\u201329. She earned her master\u2019s degree in 1927, and an\narticle with the same title as that of her master\u2019s thesis appeared in the American\nMathematical Monthly the following year. While at Indiana she also worked on a\ntables computation project directed by Harold T. Davis, which was published as\na two-volume work in 1933 and 1935. Price\u2019s doctorate was granted by Indiana\nin 1932. At Indiana she was a member of Pi Lambda Theta and Kappa Delta Pi,\neducation honor societies; Sigma Xi; and Phi Beta Sigma, a service fraternity.\n\nAfter her graduate studies, Price had three somewhat distinct careers. She was\na college professor for about \ufb01fteen years, then worked as a statistician for the US\nAir Force for a dozen years, and \ufb01nally was self-employed as a real estate agent\nfor more than forty years. From 1929 to 1944 she was professor of mathematics\nat Oshkosh Teachers College (now University of Wisconsin Oshkosh). She went to\nOshkosh the year after the arrival of May Beenken, the department head. While\nthere Price taught the full range of mathematics courses o\ufb00ered by the college. In\naddition to maintaining memberships in various professional associations, she was\nactive in the Wisconsin Section of the MAA and served on the program committee\n1934\u201335 and 1939\u201340 and as chairman of the section 1941\u201342. She also belonged to\nthe Oshkosh Education Association, for which she served as treasurer for several\nyears after 1936, and the AAUW, for which she was president of the Oshkosh branch\n1942\u201343.\n\nIn 1944 Price began her employment as a statistician for the Headquarters of\nthe Air Materiel Command at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base in Ohio. While\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nPRICE - 2\n\nin Ohio she coauthored a technical report and taught several evening courses in\ncollege mathematics in Dayton and at Miami University in nearby Oxford. Price\nremained in Ohio until 1949, when she moved to Alamogordo, New Mexico, where\nshe directed mathematical research on guided missiles at the Holloman Air Force\nBase until 1953. She then took a position as a mathematician at White Sands\nProving Ground where she stayed until 1956. While in these positions she authored,\nsometimes jointly, technical reports about data reduction. These reports dealt with\nthe recording of measurements made by sophisticated instruments such as miniature\ninfrared analyzers (MIRAN) and \ufb01ring error indicators (FEI). According to her\nobituary, \u201cshe was charged with developing mathematical theories of tracking the\nspeed, path, and trajectory of missiles being tested at White Sands Missile Range.\u201d\nShe also gave talks about this and related work in the early 1950s at conferences\nheld at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base, Holloman Air Force Base, and White\nSands Proving Ground.\n\nIn 1956 Irene Price became owner of Price Realty and after 1956 was engaged in\na number of professional activities associated with this business. She held various\no\ufb03ces in the Alamogordo Board of Realtors, was district director of the New Mexico\nRealtors Association 1962\u201364, and was a member of the National Association of\nRealtors. In 1971 she taught a college course in real estate practice to retiring\nmilitary at Holloman Air Force Base, and in 1978 she was named Alamogordo\nRealtor of the Year by the Alamogordo Board of Realtors. She retired from the real\nestate business in January 1998 at ninety-six.\n\nIn about 1940 Price described her hobbies as going on picnics and gardening.\nIn 1981 Price reported other interests; she wrote that she was a\ufb03liated with the\nChristian Church and was a member of the John Birch Society, Business and Pro-\nfessional Women (treasurer 1957), the Republican Women\u2019s Club 1963\u201365, Women\nAware, and the Alamogordo Chamber of Commerce. She was also a trustee of the\nBetty Dare Foundation and a member of the advisory board of the Betty Dare\nGood Samaritan Center, a nursing home.\n\nIrene Price was ninety-seven when she died at the Aristocrat Assisted Living\nCenter in Alamogordo, New Mexico, in 1999. She was cremated and a memorial\nservice was celebrated at a Christian Church in Alamogordo. She was survived by\na sister, a cousin, and nieces and nephews.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, ASA, Econometric Soc., AAUW, Sigma Xi.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1927 Laplace\u2019s calculus of generatrix functions.

August 12, 1909\u2013January 3, 1978.\nBarnard College (BA 1931), Cornell University (MA 1932), Brown University\n(PhD 1939).\n\nEsther Ober McCormick was the elder of two surviving children of Ethel Mary (Ober),\nborn in Ohio in 1879, and Thomas Holmes McCormick, born in Indiana in 1875. Her\nparents were both students at Hiram College in Ohio; her mother was there for one year,\n1900\u201301, and her father graduated in 1902, shortly before their marriage in June of that\nyear. Their \ufb01rst daughter died in infancy.\n\nEsther McCormick was born in Fort Wayne, Indiana, where her father was a mathe-\nmatics teacher at Fort Wayne High School. At some point her mother gave guitar lessons.\nHer younger brother, Edgar T. McCormick (1914\u20131991), was born in New York City after\nthe family moved there in the summer of 1913. Edgar McCormick later attended Princeton\nUniversity and became an analyst for Prudential Life Insurance. An avid and successful\nchess player, he also was chess team coach for Prudential. For a few years, the family lived\nin New York City where her father was a teacher of mathematics at the Commercial High\nSchool and occasionally served as a substitute preacher. He continued to teach at the high\nschool after the family moved to East Orange, New Jersey. Esther McCormick graduated\nfrom Eastern Grammar School in East Orange in 1923 and from East Orange High School\nin 1927.\n\nMcCormick attended Barnard College, Columbia University, where she majored in\nmathematics and studied primarily with Lulu Hofmann (Bechtolsheim) and Edward Kas-\nner. She took several graduate courses at Columbia in addition to her undergraduate work.\nShe joined the AMS in the summer of 1930 and attended two meetings of the society before\nshe received her bachelor\u2019s degree in February 1931.\n\nShe immediately entered graduate school at Cornell for the second term of the academic\nyear 1930\u201331 and returned to Columbia for graduate work during the summer of 1931.\nShe had a graduate scholarship at Cornell for 1931\u201332 and received her master\u2019s degree\nin February 1932, having done her work in geometry and written her master\u2019s thesis with\nVirgil Snyder. She stayed at Cornell through the end of that academic year before going\nto Brown University for the year 1932\u201333 with a scholarship and part-time work.\n\nWhile a student at Cornell, McCormick met Charles Chapman Torrance, who had\nreceived a PhD in mathematics from Cornell in 1931 and was an instructor there from\n1927 until 1931. C. C. Torrance (1902\u20131967) was born in Yonkers, New York, and had\nearned an ME in 1922 and an MA in 1927 from Cornell. He spent 1931\u201332 as an instructor\nat Stanford and 1933\u201334 at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. During 1933\u2013\n34 Esther McCormick traveled in Europe before marrying Charles Torrance on June 19,\n1934. A daughter later reported that a professor at Cornell told her that Charles was\nbrilliant, and that the best contribution she could make to the world of mathematics was\nto marry him and keep him happy and productive.\n\nC. C. Torrance was a member of the faculty at Case School of Applied Science in\nCleveland, Ohio, from 1934 until 1946 and was a contract mathematician at the Bureau\nof Ordnance of the Navy Department at Washington, D.C., 1944\u201345. At Case he was\ninstructor 1934\u201340, assistant professor 1940\u201344, and associate professor 1945\u201346.\n\nEsther Torrance was an instructor at Oberlin College 1937\u201338. Both of the Torrances\nwere in residence at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton during 1938\u201339. A\ndaughter reported that hers was a courtesy invitation while C. C. Torrance was working\nwith von Neumann. During that year Charles and Esther Torrance translated an article\nby Arnaud Denjoy of the Institut Henri Poincar\u00b4e that appeared in the Duke Mathematical\nJournal. Esther Torrance \ufb01nished the work for her PhD at Brown in 1939.\n\nAfter several miscarriages, two daughters were born, both of whom later earned doctor-\nates. Ellen McCormick was born in March 1941, did her undergraduate work at Barnard,\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nTORRANCE - 2\n\nreceived a master\u2019s degree from Stanford, and received a PhD in mathematics in 1968 from\nthe University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign. Wendy was born in April 1942, did her\nundergraduate work at Occidental College in Los Angeles, and received a PhD in physics\nin 1971, also from the University of Illinois.\n\nIn 1946 C. C. Torrance moved to the Naval Postgraduate School in Annapolis, Mary-\nland, and was associate professor 1946\u201350 and professor 1950 until his retirement in May\n1967. When the school moved to Monterey, California, in December 1951, the Torrances\nmoved to the West Coast. Esther Torrance taught in high school in Salinas for a brief\ntime in the late 1950s or early 1960s. Her husband died very soon after his retirement,\nand afterwards Esther Torrance moved to Fresno. She was assistant professor at Fresno\nState College (California State University, Fresno since 1972) from 1967 until her retire-\nment in 1972, after an unsuccessful bid for tenure. She moved back to Monterey after her\nretirement.\n\nEsther Torrance was described by her younger daughter as \u201cformal and forbidding, but\nwould go way out of her way to be of service.\u201d When they lived in Annapolis, she was par-\nticularly active in a number of community organizations, serving as an advisory member\nof the Anne Arundel Youth Commission, as a member of the Annapolis Planning Com-\nmission, and on the board of directors of the Citizens Planning and Housing Association\nof Annapolis and Anne Arundel County. She was also a registered lobbyist in Congress\nfor a housing coalition. According to her younger daughter, \u201cshe idolized Jane Addams\nof Hull House.\u201d She played the stock market for both fun and pro\ufb01t and played chess by\nmail and bridge. She loved long walks and camping in Yosemite, where every summer she\nand the girls would camp two to three weeks and be joined by her husband for a shorter\ntime. In August 1977, a few months before her death, she climbed Mt. Whitney, the tallest\nmountain in the contiguous United States. At this time, too, she was working for passage\nof the ERA. She was a member of the Disciples of Christ and was active in the Paci\ufb01c\nGrove church.\n\nAfter a series of strokes and heart attacks in December 1977 and early January 1978,\n\nEsther Torrance died in January 1978 at age sixty-eight in Monterey, California.\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, AWM.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1932 [McCormick, E.

January 16, 1897\u2013July 16, 1942.\nUniversity of Missouri (BS 1921, MA 1922, PhD 1929).\n\nEmily Kathryn Wyant was born in Ipava, Illinois, the younger of two children of Alice\nMary (Dillon) (b. 1864) and Clarence Jacob Wyant (b. 1871), natives of Illinois. Her older\nbrother, Kenneth D., was born in 1894. In 1900 the family was living in Dixon, in northern\nIllinois, and her father\u2019s occupation was described in the census report as \u201cstudent.\u201d\nKathryn Wyant attended a country grade school in Bader, Illinois, about twenty-\ufb01ve\nmiles from Ipava. In 1910 the family was living in Bolivar, Missouri, where her father was\na merchant. Kathryn graduated from the high school there in May 1914.\n\nWyant entered the University of Missouri in June 1914 and did most of her under-\ngraduate work in summer sessions there. She taught two winters in rural schools in Polk\nCounty, Missouri, and three in the high schools at Callao and Neosho, Missouri, before\nreceiving her BS in education in June 1921.\n\nWyant was an instructor in mathematics at the University of Missouri from 1921 until\n1930. She completed her master\u2019s degree at Missouri with a major in physics and a minor\nin mathematics in 1922. After having attended one summer session at the University of\nChicago, she completed the work for her PhD at Missouri with a major in mathematics\nand a minor in astronomy. Her 1929 dissertation was directed by G. E. Wahlin. She also\nthanked W. D. A. Westfall, Louis Ingold, E. S. Haynes, and E. R. Hedrick for their interest\nin her work.\n\nFrom 1930 to 1933 Wyant was professor of mathematics at Northeastern State Teachers\nCollege (now Northeastern State University) in Tahlequah, Oklahoma. From 1933 to 1934\nWyant did postgraduate work at the University of Chicago before joining, in 1934, the\nfaculty at Athens College (now Athens State University) in Athens, Alabama. The college,\nfounded in 1822 as Athens Female Academy, had become coeducational in 1931. She served\nas chairman of the department of mathematics there until her early retirement in 1940\nbecause of ill health.\n\nThroughout her career Wyant was unusually active in professional and honorary so-\ncieties. While she was at Missouri she was particularly involved with the mathematics\nhonorary fraternity Pi Mu Epsilon, the graduate women\u2019s scienti\ufb01c fraternity Sigma Delta\nEpsilon, and the MAA. In 1925 she was the corresponding secretary of the University of\nMissouri chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon when there were only nine chapters. She was national\nvice president of Sigma Delta Epsilon in 1926 and president from June to December 1926.\nThe following year she was chairman of the Missouri Section of the MAA. Also during\nthis period Wyant became interested in some Diophantine problems and solutions that\nhad appeared in The Missouri Intelligencer in 1823 and 1824 and spoke about them to\nthe local Pi Mu Epsilon chapter and to the Missouri Section of the MAA.\n\nWhile at Northeastern State Teachers College, Wyant transformed the existing math-\nematics club into the \ufb01rst chapter of Kappa Mu Epsilon, a mathematics honor society for\nschools that place an emphasis on undergraduate education. This \ufb01rst chapter was installed\nin 1931 with twenty-four members, and by the end of 1932 there were six chapters. Kappa\nMu Epsilon was granted membership into the Association of College Honor Societies in\n1968. The society produces a journal, The Pentagon, and has grown to over a hundred\nchapters. In addition to founding Kappa Mu Epsilon, she served as its \ufb01rst national pres-\nident 1931\u201335 and its fourth national historian 1939\u201341. In 1936 she was a co-founder\nof the Tennessee Valley Mathematics Association for high school teachers, junior college\nteachers, and others interested in mathematics. She served as secretary-treasurer of the\nmathematics division of the Alabama Education Association 1936\u201337.\n\nWyant was a Methodist and was a member of the Order of the Eastern Star. In about\n1940 she listed her hobbies as supervising mathematics fraternity work and driving her car.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWYANT - 2\n\nShe also indicated that her favorite recreation was \u201cplaying with cocker spaniel\u201d (AmWom\n1935\u201340).\n\nIn 1940 Wyant was living in Birmingham, Alabama; she was living outside of Athens,\nAlabama, at the time of her death at age forty-\ufb01ve in 1942.

August 19, 1904\u2013August 28, 2000.\nRandolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College (BA 1926), University of Chicago (MS\n1927, PhD 1931).\n\nEmily McCoy Chandler was born in Knoxville, Tennessee, the daughter of Mayme\n(McCoy) (b. ca. 1879) and David Sanders Chandler (b. 1876), both Tennessee na-\ntives. The 1920 census lists three daughters: Emily, age \ufb01fteen; Dorothy A., age ten;\nand Carlotta B., age two months. Her father was a district passenger agent with\nthe railroad.\n\nChandler attended primary and secondary school in the Knoxville public school\nsystem and graduated from Knoxville High School in 1922. She then entered Ran-\ndolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College (now Randolph College) in Lynchburg, Virginia,\nwhere she majored in psychology and mathematics and minored in English. One\nof her teachers was Gillie Larew, who had been a mathematics faculty member at\nRandolph-Macon since 1903 and who later served as a personal reference for Chan-\ndler. While at Randolph-Macon, Chandler was active in student government, the\nYWCA, and the Inter-racial Committee. Immediately after her graduation, Chan-\ndler entered graduate school at the University of Chicago in the summer quarter\nof 1926. She attended four straight quarters before receiving her master\u2019s degree in\n1927 with a thesis in analysis written under the direction of L. M. Graves.\n\nAfter receiving her master\u2019s degree, Chandler took a position as instructor and\nacting head of the mathematics department at Saint Xavier College for Women\n(now Saint Xavier University) in Chicago while she continued her graduate work\npart time at the University of Chicago. After four years she \ufb01nished the work for\nher doctorate, having studied with L. E. Dickson and Mayme I. Logsdon, among\nothers. She wrote her dissertation in number theory under Dickson and received\nthe PhD in 1931.\n\nA fellow graduate student at Chicago was Henry Howes Pixley, who also earned\na master\u2019s degree in mathematics in 1927 and a doctorate in 1931 as a student\nof Graves. Pixley was born in Skaneateles, New York, on July 18, 1902, received\nmost of his elementary and secondary education in Michigan, graduated from high\nschool in Florida, and received his BA degree in 1923 and MA degree in 1924 from\nJohn B. Stetson University in Deland, Florida. Between 1924 and 1931, the date of\nhis doctorate from Chicago, Henry Pixley held instructorships at Georgia School of\nTechnology (now Georgia Institute of Technology), Rutgers University, Bryn Mawr\nCollege, and the College of the City of Detroit. Emily Chandler and Henry Pixley\nwere married on September 8, 1931.\n\nAlthough inquires for a position in Detroit for Emily Chandler were made in\nthe spring of 1931, both Pixleys retained their positions after their marriage, she at\nSaint Xavier in Chicago, where she continued as professor and department chairman\n1930\u201336, and he at the College of the City of Detroit as instructor 1930\u201334. In 1933\u2013\n34 Emily and Henry Pixley had leaves of absence from their academic positions and\nworked in areas having to do with labor productivity and mathematical economics\nfor the National Recovery Administration. Three of the tables she prepared for the\nNRA appeared in a 1935 article, \u201cEconomic theory of the shorter work week,\u201d by\nCharles F. Roos (Econometrica 3:21\u201339).\n\nIn 1933 the College of the City of Detroit united with other public colleges in\nDetroit, and in 1934 the institution was named Wayne University; it was renamed\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nPIXLEY - 2\n\nWayne State University in 1956. Henry Pixley remained at Wayne as assistant\nprofessor 1934\u201337 and associate professor from 1937 until his retirement in 1972.\nAfter 1945 his responsibilities were largely administrative; he was assistant dean of\nthe College of Liberal Arts 1945\u201347; director of admissions, records, and registration\n1947\u201353; and associate dean of administration 1953\u201369 before returning to the\nclassroom as associate professor.\n\nIn 1936 Emily Pixley began an association of a dozen years with Wayne Univer-\nsity. She was hired in September 1936 as a special instructor with an hourly salary.\nShe worked as a special instructor part time 1936\u201342 and full time 1942\u201347. Also,\nduring her \ufb01rst years there, the Pixleys had three children: Dorothy Anne, born in\nAugust 1937; David Chandler, born in June 1939; and Richard Henry, born in June\n1942.\n\nIn September 1947 the title of Emily Pixley\u2019s position changed from special in-\nstructor to regular substitute assistant professor with a teaching load of sixteen\nhours per week. In April 1948, in a memo from the mathematics department chair-\nman to the dean, it was noted that there had been \u201cprogress in the matter of\nadherence to the university policy relative to employment of man and wife,\u201d a pol-\nicy that had been ignored for three years because of the di\ufb03culty in hiring \u201cquali\ufb01ed\npersonnel.\u201d He also wrote that \u201cwhile the quality of teaching will be lowered some-\nwhat by making Mrs. Borgman and Mrs. Pixley the \ufb01rst to go, university policy\ndemands that this be done, and I have already made clear to those a\ufb00ected that\nthis will require the termination of their services in June 1949\u201d (Alfred L. Nel-\nson, Mathematics Department, to Dean C. B. Hilberry, April 23, 1948, University\nArchives, Wayne State University).\n\nEmily Pixley did not wait for the university anti-nepotism policy to be satis\ufb01ed\nby the termination of her services in 1949, but found employment at the University\nof Detroit (now University of Detroit Mercy) for the academic year 1948\u201349. She\nspent the remaining twenty-\ufb01ve years of her career there: as assistant professor\n1948\u201351, associate professor 1951\u201356, and professor from 1956 until her retirement\nin 1973 as professor emeritus. She also served as acting department chair in the\nsummers 1963\u201369 and in the academic year 1968\u201369. One of her sons reported for\nher obituary in the Detroit Free Press that \u201cshe was never formally named chair\nbecause of her gender.\u201d\n\nIn the late 1940s Emily Pixley indicated that her church preference was Congre-\ngational and that she had traveled in Alaska, Europe, and the United States. She\nalso noted that she read French, German, and Italian. She had recently served as\nchairman of the faculty wives scholarship committee at Wayne and as president of\nthe Randolph-Macon alumnae, presumably in Detroit.\n\nHenry Pixley died in Detroit on October 9, 1985, at age eighty-three.

March 30, 1864\u2013May 2, 1949.\nWellesley College (BA 1886), Yale University (PhD 1903).\n\nHelen Abbot Merrill was born in Orange, New Jersey, the \ufb01fth of seven children of\nEmily Dodge (Abbot) (1830\u20131889) and George Merrill (b. 1827). Both of her parents\nwere born in Massachusetts, her mother in Ipswich and her father in Newburyport;\nthey married in Brooklyn in 1851. Her \ufb01rst American paternal ancestor had arrived\nfrom England in 1633. Her father graduated from high school and was in the life\ninsurance business, \ufb01rst in Newburyport and later in New Brunswick, New Jersey.\nIn 1860 he was a merchant, in 1870 a dry goods merchant, and in 1880 a grain\nmerchant. In 1958 he was described as having been an importer, insurance auditor,\nand inventor. The other children in the family were: Mary Elizabeth (b. 1852),\nGeorge Francis (1857\u20131858), Francis Gordon (b. 1859), Emily Dodge (b. 1861),\nWilliam Pierson (1867\u20131954), and Robert Dodge (b. 1871). The three sons who\nsurvived to adulthood all graduated from theological seminary.\n\nMerrill attended public schools in Newburyport and in New Brunswick. She took\nthe classical course as an undergraduate at Wellesley with her main subjects being\nmathematics, Greek, Latin, science, and history. At the time she was at Wellesley,\nat the end of its \ufb01rst decade and start of its second, the mathematics department\nhad a full four-year curriculum, which was considered one of the strongest in the\ncollege, and the department head was Helen Schafer, who was soon to become the\nthird president of the college.\n\nHelen Merrill graduated from Wellesley in 1886, the same year as Ellen Pendel-\nton, who was to become a colleague in the mathematics department and Welles-\nley\u2019s sixth president. That same year Winifred Edgerton (Merrill), Wellesley class\nof 1883, became the \ufb01rst woman in the United States to be granted a PhD in math-\nematics. After her graduation, Helen Merrill taught at the Classical School for Girls\nin New York City 1886\u201389 and at Walnut Lane School in Germantown, Pennsylva-\nnia, 1891\u201393. As a volunteer, she taught mill girls for the Dutch Reformed Church\nin New Brunswick in the years 1889\u201391.\n\nMerrill began her long tenure as a faculty member at Wellesley College in 1893.\nDuring her \ufb01rst year teaching she also studied mathematics at Wellesley. She was an\ninstructor during the period 1893\u20131901 except for the year 1896\u201397, when she was\na graduate student at the University of Chicago. Her sister Emily Dodge Merrill\nattended Wellesley as a special student 1895\u201397. Helen Merrill was promoted to\nassociate professor in 1901 but had a leave of absence from the college for study\nat G\u00a8ottingen and for travel in England and Italy during the year 1901\u201302 and for\nstudy at Yale during the academic year 1902\u201303. While an associate professor, she\nwas elected an alumna member of Phi Beta Kappa from Wellesley.\n\nIn a letter of August 3, 1902, to Professor Andrew Phillips of Yale, whom she\nhad met two years earlier, she wrote, \u201cI expect to come to Yale University this\nfall for work in Mathematics. There will, I suppose be no formalities necessary for\nmy admission, as I am a member of the Mathematics Department of Wellesley\nCollege\u201d (Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Yale University, Student Records\n(RU 262), Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University Library). During that year\nshe had courses with James Pierpont in the advanced theory of functions and with\nE. R. Hedrick and H. E. Hawkes in partial di\ufb00erential equations. Although there\nappears to be no o\ufb03cial record of Merrill\u2019s advisor, her name appears on the partial\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMERRILL, H. A. - 2\n\nlist of students of James Pierpont in his obituary in the Bulletin of the AMS. The\ncommittee that examined and approved her thesis and record at Yale and that\nrecommended her for the PhD consisted of P. F. Smith, J. P. Pierpont, and M. B.\nPorter, with Pierpont signing for Porter who was then at the University of Texas.\nMerrill\u2019s dissertation in analysis concerning solutions of certain types of di\ufb00erential\nequations extends earlier results of Porter, who had earned a PhD at Harvard in\n1897 and had been an instructor at Yale 1899\u20131902. Merrill received her PhD in\n1903, and Porter sponsored the presentation of her dissertation results at the 1903\nsummer meeting in Cambridge, Massachusetts.\n\nDuring the rest of her career at Wellesley, Merrill was associate professor 1901\u2013\n15, professor 1915\u201331, Lewis Atterbury Stimson professor 1931\u201332, and professor\nemeritus 1932\u201349. She was chairman of the department from 1916 until her retire-\nment in 1932. She had a leave of absence in 1914\u201315 for the Napier Conference in\nEdinburgh and for travel in Great Britain, Canada, and the United States; she also\nattended a summer session at the University of California in 1915. In 1922\u201323 she\nhad another leave for work in English university libraries and for travel in France\nand Italy.\n\nWhile on the faculty at Wellesley, Merrill was engaged in many professional and\nwriting activities. She joined the AMS in October 1903 and was listed in the Janu-\nary 1, 1904, membership list as a life member. She was a particularly active member\nof the MAA, which she joined as a charter member in 1916 along with six of her\nWellesley colleagues. She was an associate editor of the American Mathematical\nMonthly 1916\u201319, served on the executive council 1917\u201319, and was vice president\nin 1920, the year the executive council became the board of trustees. Her publica-\ntions include a textbook, A First Course in Higher Algebra, coauthored with her\ncolleague Clara E. Smith, published in 1917. Merrill also wrote mathematical po-\netry and songs, some of which appeared in the Mathematics Teacher. Her highly\nacclaimed book, Mathematical Excursions, often used as a source for mathematics\nclub presentations, was published in 1933 and was reprinted by Dover Publications\nin 1958. In 1944, a dozen years after her retirement, she presented to the depart-\nment \u201cA History of The Department of Mathematics, Wellesley College, from the\nopening of the College in 1875\u201d; it is currently in the Wellesley archives.\n\nMerrill was also engaged in a number of non-professional activities. In 1914\nshe reported that she was a member of the College Settlements Association, Con-\nsumers\u2019 League, National Child Labor Association, and American Society For Ju-\ndicial Settlement of International Disputes. At that time she was a Presbyterian\nand indicated that she favored woman su\ufb00rage. In the summer of 1917 she taught\ntrigonometry in an aviation camp. She also worked with the College Entrance Ex-\namination Board. She was a member of the Religious Education Association and\nthe Massachusetts Civic League.\n\nIn 1942 she described herself as a Republican and a member of the Congrega-\ntional church, formerly a Presbyterian. She also indicated that she enjoyed hand-\niwork, puzzles, and writing. She made four trips to Europe, two for a year each,\nthe last to France, Italy, and England in 1922\u201323. Her travel included trips to Nova\nScotia in 1906; to England, Scotland, and Wales in the summers of 1911 and 1914;\nto California and the Canadian Rockies in the spring and summer of 1915; and fre-\nquent trips to North Carolina. She was also interested in model-making and other\nhandicrafts, and music.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMERRILL, H. A. - 3\n\nHelen Merrill died in 1949 of carcinoma at age eighty-\ufb01ve in her home in Welles-\nley. The funeral was held in the Wellesley College chapel, and she was buried in the\nGreen-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. She was survived by two brothers,\nthe Rev. Dr. William Pierson Merrill, at that time pastor emeritus of the Brick\nPresbyterian Church in New York, and the Rev. Robert Dodge Merrill, then of\nSeneca Falls, New York. A special AMS fund of $650 was established by her estate\nto \u201cuse in the interest of mathematical research\u201d; starting in 1971, the descrip-\ntion of the fund changed to one that \u201cis available for the use of the Society at the\ndiscretion of the governing bodies\u201d (Bull.

July 18, 1872\u2013March 4, 1963.\nWellesley College (BA 1898), Columbia University (Teachers College) (MA\n1899), Johns Hopkins University (PhD 1914).\n\nMabel Minerva Young was born in Worcester, Massachusetts, the daughter of Minerva\n(Tyler) (1847\u20131894) and Willie C. Young (1847\u20131909), both of Massachusetts. Her mother\ngraduated from the Oread Institute, a private school and college for girls and women in\nWorcester, before her marriage in 1871. She was later described as musical. In 1880 the\nYoungs and their two daughters, Mabel, age seven, and Edith, age two, were living in\nWorcester with Willie Young\u2019s parents. Willie Young was a machinist and bookkeeper\nand later president of the W. C. Young Manufacturing Company that made machinists\u2019\ntools. He was chairman of the school committee at the time of his wife\u2019s death and was a\nRepublican member of the Massachusetts state legislature in 1896 and 1897. He remarried\nin 1897. Edith C. Young was in the Wellesley College class of 1900.\n\nMabel Young attended public schools in Worcester for her primary and secondary\neducation. For the latter she completed a \ufb01ve-year course at Classical High School, from\nwhich she graduated as salutatorian. It was observed in a 1941 article in the Wellesley\nAlumnae Magazine that when she entered Wellesley College in 1894 she was unusually well\nprepared, especially in Greek, Latin, and mathematics, and that she had already decided\non mathematics thanks to an excellent high school teacher.\n\nDuring her four years at Wellesley, Young studied mainly English, mathematics, phi-\nlosophy, and psychology before receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1898. She spent the next\nyear, 1898\u201399, at Columbia University, where she did work in education and psychology\nand earned her MA and a master\u2019s diploma in education from Teachers College, Columbia,\nin 1899.\n\nYoung taught in schools 1899\u20131904. In particular, from 1899 to 1902, she taught mainly\nEnglish at the North\ufb01eld Seminary, a girls\u2019 preparatory school in Massachusetts. In 1904\nshe returned to Wellesley as an assistant in mathematics and was made an instructor\nin 1906. In 1904\u201308 she was enrolled in three hours a week of graduate courses in pure\nmathematics at Wellesley. At the same time, she was teaching one or two freshman sections\neach semester. Young did graduate work at Cornell University during the summer of 1908.\nYoung applied for admission to the Johns Hopkins University in the fall of 1909, was\naccepted, and was in residence there 1909\u201310 and again 1912\u201314, while she had leaves of\nabsence from Wellesley 1909\u201311 and 1912\u201314. She was a fellow by courtesy at Johns Hop-\nkins, with remission of tuition fees, 1913\u201314. Her dissertation in algebraic geometry was\ndirected by Frank Morley. Morley and Abraham Cohen signed the recommendation for\nits acceptance on May 30, 1914: \u201cThe problem is solved completely; and the work is done\ncarefully and understandingly. The style shows a cautious and critical New England intel-\nligence\u201d (Student \ufb01les, Ferdinand Hamburger Archives, The Johns Hopkins University).\nYoung received her doctorate in 1914 with physics as a \ufb01rst subordinate subject.\n\nThe remainder of Young\u2019s career was spent at Wellesley. She remained an instructor\nuntil 1919; she was assistant professor 1919\u201324, associate professor 1924\u201330, professor\n1930\u201341, and emeritus professor after her retirement in 1941. During the year 1930\u201331 she\ntraveled for six months in the Mediterranean region while on a leave of absence for study\nand travel.\n\nYoung was a charter member of the MAA and served on the arrangements committee\nfor the \ufb01rst summer meeting of the MAA that was held at MIT in September 1916. Two\nyears later she and Helen Merrill, then chairman of the department at Wellesley, prepared\nthe index for the 1918 volume of the Monthly. From the early 1920s through the early\n1930s, Young was also a regular contributor of problems and solutions to the Monthly.\n\nIn 1932 Helen Merrill retired from Wellesley and the department chairmanship that she\nhad held for sixteen years. The following year Young became department chairman and\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nYOUNG - 2\n\nremained so until her retirement. She was the Lewis Atterbury Stimson professor for some\nyears. Her teaching at Wellesley included primarily geometry and statistics, although she\npreferred the theoretical to the more applied work.\n\nYoung\u2019s interests included music and travel. In addition to that noted above, she trav-\neled in France and Germany in the summer of 1922 and in Norway and Sweden in the\nsummer of 1936 when she attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Oslo.\nIn about 1940 she described herself as Congregational and a Republican.

      "text": "CHANLER, Josephine H. April 7, 1906\u2013December 23, 1992.\nWestern Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College (BA 1927),\nUniversity of Illinois (MA 1930, PhD 1933).\n\nJosephine Hughes Chanler was the only child of Louisa Castle (Hughes) (1869\u2013\n1948) and James H. Chanler. Although she was born in St. Louis, she and her\nmother were there only brie\ufb02y, staying in a friend\u2019s apartment while her father was\naway looking for timber for a lumber company. A few weeks after Josephine\u2019s birth,\nshe and her mother returned to Bowling Green, Kentucky, where her mother\u2019s\nfamily lived. Her father was away from the family after that time, although her\nparents corresponded until about 1918.\n\nJosephine Chanler\u2019s mother had begun teaching at age eighteen and had at-\ntended, but not received a degree from, Pleasant J. Potter College, a college for\nwomen with preparatory and degree programs in Bowling Green that was char-\ntered in 1890. Her mother taught in grade school and then in high school in nearby\nFranklin, Kentucky, so Josephine and her mother typically lived in Franklin in the\nwinters and in Bowling Green in the summers.\n\nJosephine Chanler contracted polio as a child and had surgery at various times\nin her life as a consequence. She attended schools in both Franklin and Bowling\nGreen. She noted later that she started high school at age eleven in Franklin. At\nabout this time her mother was teaching history in a small college there, but was\nunable to return to her job after an illness and surgery. Josephine Chanler then\nattended a half year of high school in Bowling Green, before she and her mother\nwent to Jacksonville, Florida, to stay with family; she graduated in 1923, at age\nseventeen, from Duval High School in Jacksonville.\n\nChanler credited her grandfather with starting to teach her mathematics at an\nearly age and her mother with encouraging her to go to college and later to do grad-\nuate work. Thus, after her high school education they returned to Bowling Green\nwhere she entered Western Kentucky State Normal School and Teachers College\n(now Western Kentucky University). The college had awarded its \ufb01rst degree (bac-\ncalaureate) in 1924. Chanler noted later that her tuition at Western Kentucky was\nten dollars a semester. She graduated in 1927 and that summer published a poem\nin a journal of the Kentucky Folk-Lore Society. Immediately after her graduation,\nshe taught mathematics for two years in the high school in Bowling Green.\n\nChanler\u2019s mother mortgaged the house she had inherited in Bowling Green, and\nthey moved to Illinois in 1929 so Josephine Chanler could begin her graduate work\nat the University of Illinois. She was unable to get an assistantship the \ufb01rst year\nsince her undergraduate degree was not from a fully accredited school. However,\nshe earned her master\u2019s degree in 1930 with a thesis written under the direction\nof Bessie Irving Miller, who had earned her PhD at Johns Hopkins University in\n1914, one of the \ufb01rst two doctoral students of Arthur B. Coble. Coble, who was to\nbecome Chanler\u2019s doctoral dissertation advisor, had come to Illinois as professor in\n1918, while Miller had come as an instructor in 1928 after heading the mathematics\ndepartment at Rockford College in Illinois. Miller died suddenly a few months after\nChanler received her master\u2019s degree. Chanler remained at Illinois and was a fellow\nin mathematics 1930\u201331 and then an assistant in mathematics while \ufb01nishing the\nwork for her doctorate in 1933 with a minor in physics. In the six years after she\nreceived her PhD, Chanler published \ufb01ve papers in algebraic geometry.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCHANLER - 2\n\nChanler remained at Illinois for the rest of her career, although she had an op-\nportunity to take a position as assistant professor at a women\u2019s college in New\nEngland in the mid-1930s. She was assistant until 1937, instructor 1937\u201339, asso-\nciate 1939\u201345, assistant professor 1945\u201361, and associate professor 1961\u201371. When\nCoble was on leave, Chanler was the dissertation director of one doctoral student,\nFranz E. Hohn, who received his PhD in algebraic geometry in 1941. Chanler was\ndescribed by a former colleague, P. W. Ketchum, in 1983 as a \u201cvery \ufb01ne teacher.\u201d\nHe also noted that she had many \u201csubadministrative\u201d jobs in the department.\n\nIn the summers during World War II, Chanler taught in programs for servicemen.\nDuring the summers of 1959 through 1970 she was an instructor at National Science\nFoundation institutes for high school teachers at Saint Louis University. In 1968 she\nwas among four University of Illinois faculty members to record a memorial tribute\nto her advisor and colleague, Arthur Byron Coble. The tribute was reproduced in\nthe Bulletin of the AMS in 1970 (76:693\u201394).\n\nJosephine Chanler and her mother lived together until her mother\u2019s death in\n1948. They shared an apartment for a year with Echo Pepper after Pepper\u2019s apart-\nment mate, Bessie I. Miller, died. Pepper had joined the faculty at the University\nof Illinois in 1928 as an instructor. Beulah Armstrong, who had earned her PhD at\nIllinois twelve years before Chanler, was Chanler\u2019s o\ufb03ce mate for twenty years. Af-\nter the death of Chanler\u2019s mother, Armstrong, who loved to drive, took Chanler on\ntrips nearly every summer; they camped in the West and went to various summer\nmathematics meetings. Olive C. Hazlett was also a colleague for several years.\n\nChanler was a staunch Democrat and was a member of Toastmasters Interna-\ntional. Her religious interests were serious and eclectic; in about 1940 she listed\nher religion as Presbyterian; in a 1983 conversation with the author and Uta C.\nMerzbach, she described herself as \u201ca Southern Presbyterian\u2013Calvinist\u2013Catholic\nwith leanings toward Judaism and Islam and a very high regard for Buddhism,\nMormons, and some Hindu gods.\u201d An obituary noted that she was a member of St.\nMary Catholic Church.\n\nChanler maintained an apartment in Champaign for many years after her retire-\nment. There she kept in touch with numerous former students and tutored without\ncharge countless students in mathematics. She was in a health care facility for about\n\ufb01ve years before her death in Urbana at age eighty-six in 1992.

      "text": "GREENFIELD, Bella (Manel). October 13, 1915\u2013April 3, 2010.\nHunter College (BA 1935), Columbia University (MA 1936), New York Uni-\nversity (PhD 1939).\n\nBella Manel was born in New York City, the only child of Tillie (1887\u20131971) and\nJacob Manel (1882\u20131956). Both of her parents were born in Poland, and they were\nmarried there in 1911 before immigrating to the United States in 1914. In 1930 the\nfamily was living in the Bronx, and her father worked for a dress manufacturer.\n\nManel graduated from Morris High School in the Bronx in 1931 and was rec-\nognized as one of the twelve most distinguished in scholarship of the more than\n400 graduates of the school. She entered Hunter College in the fall and was elected\nto Phi Beta Kappa during her junior year. While at Hunter most of Manel\u2019s work\nin mathematics was taken with Mina Rees, and the two remained friends over the\nyears. At the Hunter College graduation ceremonies in June 1935, the Joseph A.\nGillet scholarship of forty-\ufb01ve dollars for pro\ufb01ciency in mathematics was divided\nequally between Manel and another Hunter student. Manel graduated summa cum\nlaude. Manel then studied at Columbia University and received her master\u2019s degree\nin 1936 with a thesis directed by Joseph Fels Ritt on Weyl\u2019s foundation for the\ntheory of functions.\n\nIn the fall of 1936, two years after Richard Courant\u2019s arrival in the United States,\nBella Manel began her studies at New York University and served as receptionist\nand secretary for Courant. Constance Reid, in her biography of Courant, quotes\nManel as recalling, \u201cAfter I gave my \ufb01rst report in the seminar, his attitude toward\nme changed completely. I was accepted then and asked to lunch with him and the\nother students\u201d (p. 188). In the spring of 1937 Manel received a Blumenthal fellow-\nship and was able to give up her secretarial position with Courant. She held the\nfellowship for two years and wrote her dissertation under the direction of Courant\non an aspect of Plateau\u2019s problem, a problem with which he had been involved for\na number of years. She received her PhD in 1939 with a physics minor.\n\nOn March 6, 1938, Bella Manel married Max Shi\ufb00man (1914\u20132000), a fellow\nstudent of Courant. Shi\ufb00man was born in New York City and earned a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree and a master\u2019s degree from City College of New York before receiving his\nPhD from NYU in 1938. He then served as instructor in the evening session at City\nCollege 1938\u201339 and as instructor at City College until 1942. During this period\nBella Shi\ufb00man published her dissertation and a related paper, both under the name\nBella Manel. The related paper was coauthored with Courant and her husband. The\nShi\ufb00man\u2019s \ufb01rst child, Bernard, was born in June 1942.\n\nDuring World War II and for a period thereafter, Max Shi\ufb00man was a research\nmathematician mainly working for the Applied Mathematics Panel of the O\ufb03ce of\nScienti\ufb01c Research and Development at New York University. The Shi\ufb00man\u2019s sec-\nond child, David, was born in November 1945. In 1946 Max Shi\ufb00man was appointed\nassociate professor at New York University. He was then hired as full professor at\nStanford University in 1948. According to the 2003 obituary by Peter Lax, Max\nShi\ufb00man su\ufb00ered the \ufb01rst of two schizophrenic breakdowns in 1951, with a second\noccurring in 1956.\n\nIn 1954 Bella Shi\ufb00man joined the Ramo-Wooldridge Corporation (later TRW\nInc.) in Hawthorne, California, south of Los Angeles. She described some of her\nresponsibilities on the curriculum vitae prepared after her retirement. From 1954\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGREENFIELD - 2\n\nto 1956 she \u201chired, trained and supervised a desk calculator section [that] performed\nall the space technology computations for the newly formed company before the\ndigital computer was installed. [Her] group then acted as an adjunct to the computer\ncenter.\u201d From 1956 to 1958 she \u201cworked with the designers of special purpose digital\ncomputers by doing the experimental programming during the design stages and by\ndevising the machine language. [She] developed a method of programming the RW\u2013\n30 airborne computer which did not have random access memory. [She] developed\na testing technique for checking out the RW\u2013300 computer as well as devising the\nmachine language for this desk size digital computer.\u201d She and Max Shi\ufb00man were\ndivorced in February 1957.\n\nOn June 8, 1958, Bella Manel Shi\ufb00man married Emanuel Kotkin. Kotkin, a\nwidower, was born in 1897 in London, England, and immigrated to the United\nStates in his late teens. He was the president of a manufacturing plant at the time\nof their marriage. According to his family, Emanuel Kotkin had no middle name\nbut often used \u201cE\u201d as a middle initial for business purposes. He used the name\nEmanuel Ernest Kotkin on his World War I draft registration card.\n\nFrom 1959 to 1965 Bella Kotkin worked for the Rand Corporation in Santa Mon-\nica, California, as mathematician on the professional sta\ufb00 and later as consultant.\nShe worked closely with Richard Bellman, and together they, along with others,\nproduced a number of papers and technical reports; the technical reports included\nboth research papers and working papers, which were called research memoranda.\nBella Kotkin \u201cworked on applications of mathematics and computers to medicine,\n[which] involved simulating biological experiments by computer solutions of math-\nematical models of cancer chemotherapy and other biological systems\u201d (Green\ufb01eld\ncurriculum vitae). Her work continued to be cited into the 1990s.\n\nAfter 1965 she \u201ctook time out from her professional career to spend time with\n[her] husband, who was recovering from serious surgery, and to spend time with\n[her] ailing mother. During this period [she] spent a few years doing volunteer\nwork, sometimes full time, in the area of human relations. Finally, the terminal\nnature of [her] husband\u2019s cancer condition prompted [them] to move to northern\nCalifornia near Stanford\u201d (Green\ufb01eld curriculum vitae). During the academic year\n1980\u201381 she was professor of mathematics and acting chairman of the department\nat the College of Notre Dame in Belmont, north of Palo Alto.\n\nEmanuel Kotkin died May 31, 1981, and Bella Kotkin returned to Los Angeles\nthat year. During 1982\u201384 she taught part time in the mathematics department\nat the University of California, Los Angeles. On September 17, 1984, she married\nMoses A. Green\ufb01eld, a medical physicist whose wife had died two years earlier. He\nwas professor emeritus in the Department of Radiological Sciences of the School of\nMedicine at UCLA. Moses Green\ufb01eld was born in 1915 in New York City, earned a\nbachelor\u2019s degree from the City College of New York, and earned a master\u2019s degree\nin 1937 and a PhD in 1941 from New York University. He served as director of the\nbiomedical physics graduate program at UCLA from 1960 until his retirement in\n1982 and again during 1992\u201395. After her own retirement, Bella Green\ufb01eld devoted\nherself to music as a classical pianist and to her family.\n\nIn 1995 Moses Green\ufb01eld established the Bella Manel Prize for outstanding grad-\nuate work by a woman or other member of an under-represented group at the\nCourant Institute at New York University. Bella and Moses Green\ufb01eld lived in Los\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGREENFIELD - 3\n\nAngeles until 2007, when they moved to Baltimore, where her son Bernard Shi\ufb00-\nman was professor of mathematics at Johns Hopkins University. In 2010 Bernard\nShi\ufb00man informed the authors that Moses Green\ufb01eld had developed Alzheimer\u2019s\ndisease several years earlier and that his mother had cared for her husband until\nJuly 2009, when it became too di\ufb03cult for her. Bella Green\ufb01eld died on April 3,\n2010, at age ninety-four and was buried in the Baltimore Hebrew Cemetery.

May 12, 1889\u2013October 15, 1914.\nMount Holyoke College (BA 1910), University of Chicago (MS 1911, PhD\n1913).\n\nMildred Leonora Sanderson was born in Waltham, Massachusetts, the daughter\nof Edna E. Pratt (b. 1862) and Horace M. Sanderson (b. 1856), natives of Mas-\nsachusetts. Her father was a \ufb02orist and truck farmer. In the census of 1900, there\nwere four children living of \ufb01ve born; her siblings were two older sisters, May E.\n(b. 1884) and Alice Gertrude (b. 1886), and a younger brother, Ralph H. (b. 1898).\nThe household also listed two servants from Ireland: a farm laborer and one who\ndid general housework.\n\nSanderson attended North Grammar School and Waltham High School, public\nschools in Waltham. After graduating from high school as valedictorian in 1906,\nSanderson was a student at Mount Holyoke College until her graduation in 1910.\nAt Mount Holyoke she earned general honors at the end of her sophomore year\nand honors in mathematics when she graduated. The year following her college\ngraduation Sanderson studied at the University of Chicago as the holder of the\nBardwell Memorial Fellowship from Mount Holyoke. She studied with E. H. Moore,\nL. E. Dickson, H. E. Slaught, W. D. Macmillan, G. A. Bliss, and A. S. Gale, and\nwrote her master\u2019s thesis under the direction of Dickson. During the next two years\nshe also studied with F. R. Moulton, E. J. Wilczynski, K. Laves, and A. C. Lunn,\nand wrote her dissertation in the area of modular invariant theory, again advised\nby Dickson. She received her PhD with minor work in astronomy.\n\nIn his 1915 \u201cTribute\u201d to Sanderson, Dickson described the work she did under his\ndirection noting that her master\u2019s thesis on generalizations in the theory of numbers\nand theory of linear groups \u201cmight well have served for her doctor\u2019s thesis; but she\nwas quite willing to undertake a new investigation in a wholly di\ufb00erent \ufb01eld.\u201d About\nher doctoral dissertation he wrote, \u201cThis paper is a highly important contribution\nto this new \ufb01eld of work; its importance lies partly in the fact that it establishes\na correspondence between modular and formal invariants. Her main theorem has\nalready been frequently quoted on account of its fundamental character. Her proof is\na remarkable piece of mathematics.\u201d E. T. Bell wrote in 1938 that \u201cMiss Sanderson\u2019s\nsingle contribution (1913) to modular invariants has been rated by competent judges\nas one of the classics of the subject\u201d (p. 22).\n\nSanderson was an instructor at the University of Wisconsin during the \ufb01rst se-\nmester 1913\u201314 but left in February 1914 when she became ill with pulmonary\ntuberculosis. She died at age twenty-\ufb01ve in a hospital in East Bridgewater, Mas-\nsachusetts, the following October. Services were conducted in her family\u2019s home\nin Waltham by a paster of the First Baptist Church, and she was buried in Mt.\nFeake cemetery in Waltham.

November 18, 1895\u2013February 22, 1965.\nBaker University (BA 1917), University of Kansas (MA 1918), University of\nIllinois (PhD 1921).\n\nBeulah May Armstrong was born in Sterling, Kansas, the only daughter and the\nthird of \ufb01ve children of Lillie J. (Detter), born in 1872, and John Allen Armstrong,\nborn in 1867, both natives of Pennsylvania. Her parents married in about 1888. Her\nbrothers were all born in Kansas: Guy W. in 1889, Russell B. in 1894, John A. in\n1897, and William Keith in about 1905. In 1900 the family was living in Enterprise\nTownship, Kansas, where her father was a farmer; in 1910 they were in Hutchinson,\nKansas, and her father owned or managed a hardware store. The family remained\nin Hutchinson, and no occupation was listed for her father in later census reports.\nArmstrong graduated from Hutchinson High School before entering Baker Uni-\nversity, a coeducational school a\ufb03liated with the Methodist Church, in Baldwin\nCity in eastern Kansas. While at Baker she became a member of the social sorority\nZeta Tau Alpha. After her graduation from Baker University in 1917, Armstrong\nheld a scholarship for a year at the nearby University of Kansas. She received her\nmaster\u2019s degree in 1918 and was awarded a fellowship at Kansas for the following\nyear but resigned it, apparently to continue her graduate work at the University of\nIllinois with a scholarship in 1918\u201319 and a fellowship in 1919\u201321. She received her\nPhD in 1921 from Illinois with a dissertation in group theory.\n\nArmstrong remained at Illinois as instructor 1921\u201331, associate 1931\u201345, assis-\ntant professor 1945\u201359, and associate professor from 1959 until her retirement in\n1963 as associate professor emeritus. A former colleague, P. W. Ketchum, recalled\nthat, \u201cas a teacher she was tops.\u201d She was heavily involved with advising stu-\ndents who were planning to become mathematics teachers and taught many of the\ncourses they were to take. She also was an instructor in the University of Illinois\ncorrespondence course program.\n\nArmstrong was active in a number of organizations on and o\ufb00 campus. She\nwas a charter member of the University of Illinois chapter of Sigma Delta Epsilon,\ngraduate fraternity for women in science; she remained active at the local level and\nwas honored for her contributions at the time of her retirement. She also served as\nnational treasurer in 1946 and 1947. She served as secretary and treasurer of the\nIllinois chapter of Sigma Xi and was a member of Kappa Delta Pi, an education\nhonor society. While at the University of Illinois, she continued her interest in her\ncollege social sorority, Zeta Tau Alpha, and was honored by them in 1964 for her\nservice to the Illinois chapter and the Champaign-Urbana alumnae association. She\nhad held advisory and corporate board positions for the chapter and o\ufb03ces in the\nalumnae association. After her death a memorial study in the chapter house at\nIllinois was established in her name.\n\nArmstrong was described by P. W. Ketchum as athletic, and he related that she\nand his wife, Gertrude Stith Ketchum, played volleyball. In 1937 Beulah Armstrong\nindicated that she was especially interested in reading, philanthropy, and traveling.\nFor her entry in Who\u2019s Who of American Women in the late 1950s, she identi\ufb01ed as\na Republican and a Methodist. She was a member of Wesley Methodist Church in\nUrbana, was active in the work of the Wesley Foundation, and in 1923 served as na-\ntional president of Kappa Phi, a non-denominational group for Christian university\nwomen.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nARMSTRONG - 2\n\nShortly after her retirement, Armstrong indicated that she was expecting to\nmove to a retirement community in Boulder, Colorado, in about a year and a half.\nHowever, she died suddenly of a coronary occlusion at age sixty-nine at her home in\nUrbana, Illinois, in 1965. She was survived by three brothers, Guy W. Armstrong,\nR. B. Armstrong, and W. Keith Armstrong. She was buried in Fairlawn Cemetery,\nHutchinson, Kansas.

February 19, 1908\u2013May 5, 1996.\nMount Holyoke College (BA 1929), University of Chicago (MA 1931, PhD\n1933).\n\nAbba Verbeck Newton was the younger of two daughters of Sarah C. (Verbeck)\n(1880\u20131962) and Samuel Smith Newton (1875\u20131964). Her father, born in Albany,\nNew York, and her mother, born in Ballston Spa, New York, married in 1905. Abba\nNewton and her older sister, Katharine Marguerite (1906\u20131994), were both born\nin Ballston Spa, where their father worked in the o\ufb03ce of the American Hide and\nLeather Company. Katharine Newton became an elementary school music teacher.\nAbba Newton attended Ballston Spa High School 1920\u201324 and St. Margaret\u2019s\nSchool in Waterbury, Connecticut, 1924\u201325 before entering Mount Holyoke College.\nWhile there she was in the class choir and was a Sarah Willison scholar before\ngraduating magna cum laude with major subjects mathematics and chemistry in\n1929. She taught mathematics at Science Hill School, a girls\u2019 preparatory school\nin Shelbyville, Kentucky, the following year and studied mathematics education at\nTeachers College, Columbia, in the summer of 1930.\n\nNewton attended the University of Chicago from the fall of 1930 through the\nsummer of 1933, taking o\ufb00 only one quarter, summer 1932, during that time. She\nheld a scholarship during 1932\u201333. She received her master\u2019s degree in 1931, with a\nthesis directed by Mayme Logsdon, and her doctorate in 1933, with a dissertation\ndirected by E. P. Lane.\n\nHaving received her PhD in the midst of the Great Depression, Newton was\nunemployed until April of 1934 when she began teaching in an instructor\u2019s absence\nat American International College in Spring\ufb01eld, Massachusetts. She remained there\nas instructor of mathematics and chemistry until 1938. Newton then joined the\nfaculty at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York, replacing Hazel Schoonmaker\n(Wilson) as the professor of mathematics after Schoonmaker left to marry in the\nsummer of 1938. Newton remained at Hartwick until 1943, after which she taught\ntwo classes in the summer of 1943 at the University of Chicago and held a one-year\nappointment as assistant professor at Smith College 1943\u201344 as a substitute for a\nmember of the faculty on leave for war work.\n\nIn 1944 Newton accepted an assistant professorship at Vassar College, where\nshe was to remain for the next twenty-nine years. She was promoted to associate\nprofessor in 1950 and to professor in 1957. She chaired the department at Vassar\n1950\u201351, 1953\u201358, and 1966\u201367, and retired as professor emeritus in 1973. While at\nVassar she was a faculty fellow at the Institute Henri Poincar\u00b4e at the Sorbonne in\n1951 and at Duke University in 1966. She was an NSF science faculty fellow at the\nUniversity of Michigan 1958\u201359 and a visiting research fellow at Princeton in 1971.\nAfter her retirement, Abba Verbeck continued to live in Poughkeepsie, New York.\nWhen she was younger, she had indicated an interest in tennis, rowing, and hik-\ning. Newton was a member of the Adirondack Mountain Club from about 1946 at\nleast through the early 1980s. She served as an alumnae trustee of St. Margaret\u2019s\nSchool 1965\u201370 and was a member of the Dutchess County Council on World Af-\nfairs. She was an Episcopalian and sang in the choir at Christ Episcopal Church\nin Poughkeepsie. Newton died at age eighty-eight at Eden Park Nursing Home in\nPoughkeepsie.

      "text": "GRAUSTEIN, Mary F. (Curtis). April 12, 1884\u2013July 18, 1972.\nWellesley College (BA 1906), Radcliffe College (MA 1915, PhD 1917).\n\nMary Florence Curtis was born in Westminster, Massachusetts, the eldest of \ufb01ve\nchildren of Jennie Esther (Lucas) (1857\u20131945) and Frank Abbott Curtis (1857\u2013\n1937), both of Massachusetts. Her parents married in 1883. She grew up on a land-\ngrant farm of 1790 in Westminster, in north central Massachusetts. Her siblings were\nbrothers, Wolfred Abbott (1885\u20131979), Herman Nelson (1888\u20131963), and Henry\nLucas (1891\u20131930), and a sister, Esther Jane (1896\u20131956), who was a member of\nthe Wellesley class of 1917. Her brother Herman graduated from Harvard in 1911.\nMary Curtis attended Fitchburg High School in Massachusetts 1899\u20131902 before\nentering Wellesley College in 1902. She was a Wellesley honors scholar 1904\u201305\nand 1905\u201306 and received her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1906. The two years after her\ngraduation she taught German, algebra, and geometry at Leominster High School, a\nshort distance from her family\u2019s home in Westminster, while also traveling in Europe\nin summer 1907. The following two years, from September 1908 until March 1910,\nshe taught German and natural science at Cushing Academy in Ashburnham, also\nnear her family\u2019s home. She had spent the summer semester of 1909 at Cornell\nstudying botany and pedagogy. For three semesters, from May 1910 until August\n1911, she studied mathematics and natural science at the university in Leipzig,\nGermany.\n\nUpon her return from Leipzig, she joined the Wellesley College faculty as an\ninstructor of mathematics. She was instructor from September 1911 to June 1914.\nIn the meantime, she had begun her graduate studies in mathematics at Radcli\ufb00e\nCollege in September 1913. At Radcli\ufb00e she held a Mary E. Horton fellowship from\nWellesley 1914\u201315 and earned her master\u2019s degree in 1915 and her doctorate in 1917\nwith a dissertation in di\ufb00erential geometry. Charles L. Bouton, associate professor,\nand Julian L. Coolidge, assistant professor, signed as faculty reviewers, and it is\nlikely that she worked most closely with Coolidge. Curtis spent the year 1917\u201318 at\nthe College for Women, Western Reserve University, in Cleveland, Ohio, as instruc-\ntor and acting head, replacing a faculty member who was on leave. She returned\nto Wellesley, where she was instructor 1918\u201320 and assistant professor 1920\u201321.\nShe was in Leipzig in the summer of 1920. In a November 1920 letter extracted in\nthe Bulletin of the AMS, the Italian geometer and historian of mathematics Gino\nLoria wrote to the American historian of mathematics D. E. Smith that \u201cMary F.\nCurtis had established [a] remarkable result, that every recti\ufb01able skew parabola is\na helix\u201d (27 (1921): 201). The extract from Loria\u2019s letter referred to Curtis\u2019s 1918\npaper \u201cOn the recti\ufb01ability of a twisted cubic\u201d and motivated her 1921 paper \u201cOn\nskew parabolas.\u201d\n\nOn June 10, 1921, at age thirty-seven, Mary F. Curtis married William Caspar\nGraustein in Wellesley. Graustein, born on November 15, 1888, in Cambridge, Mas-\nsachusetts, had earned both his BA in 1910 and his MA in 1911 from Harvard. He\nwas a traveling fellow from Harvard and earned his PhD in mathematics from Bonn\nin 1913. He returned to Harvard in 1913 as instructor of mathematics, and it was\nat Harvard that Mary Curtis was one of his students. He was at Rice Institute in\nHouston from 1914 to 1918. In 1919, after serving with the Ordnance Department\nof the US Army, Graustein again joined the faculty at Harvard.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGRAUSTEIN - 2\n\nAfter her marriage, Mary C. Graustein took a leave of absence for two years\nbefore she returned to Wellesley in 1923 as assistant professor. She remained at\nWellesley until 1929, with a leave of absence in her \ufb01nal year, 1928\u201329. From 1926\nuntil 1941 Graustein and Rachel Blodgett Adams were both tutors at Radcli\ufb00e,\nalthough Graustein was in Europe with her husband during the years 1928\u201329 and\n1937\u201338. Graustein\u2019s 1931 report to the Wellesley alumnae magazine gives an in-\ndication of her activities. She wrote that they were in Lugano for the winter of\n1928\u201329, where her husband \ufb01nished his textbook, Introduction to Higher Geom-\netry. During the summer of 1930 she \u201chelped with the proof reading of the book,\ncorrected papers for a course in the Summer School, and copied the manuscript for\nthe second half of a mathematical text (in German).\u201d She also described her work\nat Radcli\ufb00e in the Wellesley Magazine: \u201cMy tutorial work at Radcli\ufb00e consists of\neleven \u2018tutees.\u2019 I see each of them for an hour every other week. Three of them are\nSeniors; they and their theses on \u2018In\ufb01nite Series,\u2019 \u2018Curve Fitting\u2019 and \u2018The Number\nSystem of Algebra\u2019 do their bit to keep me busy. I enjoy the work and the girls\u201d\n(Wellesley College Alumnae O\ufb03ce). Mary Graustein was a member of the AMS\ncommittee on arrangements for its meetings at the Harvard Tercentenary in 1936.\nThe Grausteins had no children.\n\nThe Grausteins spent every other summer in the Dolomites until prevented by\nWorld War II. William C. Graustein was professor of mathematics and assistant\ndean at Harvard when he was killed in an automobile accident, at the age of \ufb01fty-\ntwo, on January 22, 1941. In 1945 his older brother Archibald established the\nWilliam Caspar Graustein Memorial Fund, which endowed a named professorship\nat Harvard, and in 1993 Archibald\u2019s son, William C. Graustein, a geochemist, en-\nlarged the fund by $50 million and extended its focus to include preschool programs\nand elementary and secondary schools in Connecticut.\n\nMary C. Graustein eventually resumed full-time teaching after her husband\u2019s\ndeath. She was at Hunter College as instructor in the summer session 1941 and then\nheld both substitute and part-time positions at Connecticut College and Abbott\nAcademy in October and November 1941 and at Hunter College the rest of 1941\u201342.\nShe was assistant professor at Oberlin College 1942\u201344 but had a leave of absence\n1943\u201344 to care for her mother who was ill. She began teaching at Tufts College\n(now University) as assistant professor in 1944. In 1949 she wrote for the Wellesley\nalumnae magazine that she had come to Tufts to teach the Navy navigation and\ncalculus and that she stayed on to teach the veterans after the war. She indicated\nthat she maintained an apartment in Cambridge and kept her family\u2019s farm in\nWestminster. She also reported in the Wellesley Magazine, \u201cLast summer in the\nmidst of much needed painting and repairing at the farm, and at the end of Summer\nSchool, I \ufb02ew to Germany for a month\u2013my \ufb01rst trip by air. I had waited all the\nprevious summer for a Military permit to go to G\u00a8ottingen to \ufb01nish some of my\nhusband\u2019s papers and had little hope of getting a permit. I could have gone to\nFrankfurt in 1947 for a year as Mathematical Consultant at our Army Center; I\nwould have enjoyed it for the summer but not for the winter\u201d (Wellesley College\nAlumnae O\ufb03ce).\n\nGraustein was promoted to associate professor at Tufts in 1950 and remained\nthere until her retirement in 1955. From 1946 until 1954, she was also faculty res-\nident of Paige Hall, a dormitory associated with Jackson College, the women\u2019s\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGRAUSTEIN - 3\n\ncoordinate college that is now fully integrated into the university. After her retire-\nment she lived at her family home in Westminster. She continued to travel and to\ngo to Cambridge for the symphony concert series. She described herself in the early\n1940s as a Congregationalist and a Republican.\n\nMary Curtis Graustein died at eighty-eight in Heywood Memorial Hospital in\nGardner, Massachusetts, and was buried in Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge.\nShe was survived by her brother Wolfred.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi.\n\nTheses and dissertation:\n1916a [Curtis, M.

August 18, 1885\u2013September 10, 1959.\nWest Virginia University (BA 1906), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1922).\n\nMargaret Buchanan was born in Clinton, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Sarah\n(Wiley) (b. 1858) and Aaron Moore Buchanan (b. 1856), natives of Pennsylvania.\nHer father graduated from Washington and Je\ufb00erson College in 1879 and from\nWestern Theological Seminary in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in 1882, the year her\nparents married. She was the second of three children; her brother, Joseph Kerr,\nwas born in 1883 in Pennsylvania, and her sister, Mary B., was born in 1894 in\nWest Virginia. Mary was deceased by 1910. Her father was a Presbyterian minister\nwho moved from Pennsylvania to Morgantown, West Virginia, in 1886. He received\nthe DD degree from Washington and Je\ufb00erson College in 1899.\n\nFrom 1898 to 1902 Margaret Buchanan attended the preparatory school of West\nVirginia University at Morgantown before entering that university in 1902. While\nthere she was one of a handful of women in her class. She was a member of the\nEnglish club, Le Cercle Dramatique Francais, the YWCA, the athletic association,\nthe yearbook board, the tennis club, the Athenaeum (student newspaper) board,\nand Kappa Delta sorority. She served as secretary of several of these organizations\nat least half a dozen times. Later, she was one of the founders of Beta Upsilon\nchapter of the social sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma there.\n\nAfter Buchanan\u2019s graduation from West Virginia University in 1906, she taught\nmathematics for a year at Marshall College (then a state normal school, now Mar-\nshall University) in Huntington, West Virginia. She returned to West Virginia Uni-\nversity in 1907 as a graduate student. She was an assistant in Greek and math-\nematics and taught in the university\u2019s preparatory school 1907\u201309. She was also\nan instructor of mathematics at the university 1909\u201312 before entering Bryn Mawr\nCollege for graduate study in 1912. She studied at Bryn Mawr College as a scholar\nin mathematics 1912\u201313, taught mathematics at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr\n1913\u201314, taught mathematics in the high school at Parkersburg, West Virginia,\n1914\u201315, and was instructor of mathematics at West Virginia University 1915\u201318.\nIn the summer of 1918 she was a temporary o\ufb03ce assistant on the scienti\ufb01c sta\ufb00\nof the state geologist preparing the statistics and coal maps for the West Virginia\ngeological survey of Webster County.\n\nBuchanan returned to her graduate studies at Bryn Mawr College as a resident\nfellow in 1918\u201319 and as a graduate scholar in 1919\u201320, having attended the Uni-\nversity of Chicago in the summer of 1919. She was awarded a President M. Carey\nThomas European fellowship in 1918\u201319 for use the following year. She postponed\nthat fellowship and was a resident scholar at Bryn Mawr 1919\u201320. She used the\npostponed fellowship and an Association of Collegiate Alumnae European fellow-\nship in 1920\u201321 to study at the Sorbonne in Paris. While there she studied under\nEdouard Goursat, Henri Lebesgue, and \u00b4Emile Picard in mathematics and under\nMarie Curie and M. Gabriel Lippmann in physics. She had previously traveled\nin Europe in the summer of 1910. In 1921\u201322 she \ufb01nished her work for the PhD\nfrom Bryn Mawr as a fellow by courtesy, the \ufb01rst doctoral student of Anna J. Pell\n(Wheeler). Her doctorate, with a minor in physics, was awarded in June 1922.\n\nBuchanan returned to the faculty of West Virginia University as assistant pro-\nfessor and was promoted to associate professor in 1925. She resigned her position\nto marry, on February 14, 1929, Harry Outen Cole (1874\u20131950). Cole was a native\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCOLE, M.

He had known Margaret Buchanan from the time she was\na child since her father was the pastor of the Presbyterian church to which he be-\nlonged. He was widowed in 1921 and from about that time was president of Cole\nBros. Construction Company in Morgantown.\n\nIn 1938 Margaret B. Cole again joined the faculty at West Virginia University\nand was instructor 1938\u201341, assistant professor 1941\u201352, associate professor 1952\u2013\n55, and associate professor emeritus after her retirement in 1955 at age sixty-nine.\nA colleague at West Virginia University was Bird M. Turner with whom she had\nalso overlapped as a graduate student at Bryn Mawr College.\n\nAs an active alumna of West Virginia University, Cole became the \ufb01rst woman\npresident of the university\u2019s alumni association in June 1939 after serving four years\non the alumni executive council. She joined the university alumni association\u2019s\nemeritus club, for alumni of \ufb01fty or more years, in 1956 and was vice president in\n1958\u201359.\n\nMargaret Buchanan Cole died in Morgantown in 1959, four years after her re-\ntirement.

August 3, 1887\u2013May 17, 1961.\nBarnard College (BA 1911), Columbia University (MA 1912, PhD 1915).\n\nCaroline Eustis Seely was born in Delhi, New York, the daughter of Sarah Au-\ngusta (Wheeler), born in 1846 in Delhi, New York, and Henry Bates Seely, born\nin 1838 in Seneca Falls, New York. Her parents married in about 1870 and had\nfour children: Carleton H. (ca. 1872\u20131885), Annie (b. ca. 1874), Mary (b. 1879),\nand Caroline. Her mother was from a Delhi professional family; Caroline\u2019s maternal\ngrandfather was an attorney in Delhi and in Chicago. Caroline Seely\u2019s father was\na naval o\ufb03cer who had graduated from the US Naval Academy in 1857. Before her\nbirth he served on a number of ships, one of which was part of the South Atlantic\nblockading squadron early in the Civil War. After 1864 he commanded several ships\nand later the Ajax, European, and South Atlantic squadrons. In 1880 Henry Seely,\nconvalescing from typhoid, was living with his wife and three children at the home\nof his mother-in-law in Delphi. From 1884 until 1891 he was captain, and then\ncommandant, of the League Island Navy Yard in Philadelphia. He commanded a\nship from March 1891 until 1892, after which he was retired. In 1900 the Seely\nfamily was living in Philadelphia. Henry Seely died there in 1901 when Caroline\nwas thirteen.\n\nIn 1910 Caroline Seely and her widowed mother were living in New York City,\nwhere Caroline Seely was attending Barnard College, from which she graduated\nwith honors in mathematics in 1911. She then did graduate work at Columbia\nUniversity and served as an assistant in mathematics to David Eugene Smith at\nTeachers College, Columbia, in 1911\u201313. Seely had taken two courses from Smith as\nan undergraduate: theory and practice of teaching mathematics during the summer\nof 1910 and history of mathematics in 1910\u201311. She received her master\u2019s degree in\n1912 with a thesis in analysis and continued her graduate work in mathematics at\nColumbia. Her doctoral dissertation, directed by Edward Kasner, was completed in\n1914, and the degree was awarded by Columbia the following year.\n\nIn 1913 Seely began a twenty-two year association with the American Mathe-\nmatical Society when she became the \ufb01rst mathematician to be employed full time\nby the society. Her \ufb01rst position with the AMS was clerical and editorial assis-\ntant. She wrote to David Eugene Smith in the fall of 1913 that she was \u201cenjoying\nher new work very much, thanks to [him], but [was] afraid she [would] be rather\nhomesick for Teachers College . . . \u201d (Professional Correspondence, David Eugene\nSmith Professional Collection, Archival Collections, Rare Book and Manuscript Li-\nbrary, Columbia University Libraries). Frank Nelson Cole, professor at Columbia\nand Barnard and secretary of the AMS since 1895, was editor-in-chief of the Bul-\nletin of the AMS from 1899 until his resignation as secretary of the society in 1920.\nIn addition to Seely\u2019s duties involving work of the society as clerk to Cole, she\nwas engaged in editorial work for the Bulletin and the Transactions of the AMS.\nSeely continued her work with the society when R. G. D. Richardson of Brown re-\nplaced Cole as secretary in 1920. Seely was o\ufb03cially associate editor of the Bulletin\n1925\u201334 and was cooperating editor of the Transactions 1924\u201336.\n\nSeely lived in New York City, where she worked for the AMS and served as\nsecretary to Cole at Columbia. During World War I, she was associated with F. R.\nMoulton and worked with the Army Ordnance Department in Washington, D.C.\nShe continued her mathematical research in analysis during and after the war. In\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSEELY - 2\n\n1918 she prepared a Union List of Mathematical Periodicals for the Bureau of\nEducation with David Eugene Smith.\n\nAt some point in 1934, Seely submitted her resignation to the AMS. In October\n1934, J. R. Kline, an associate secretary of the society, reporting for a committee to\nstudy problems of the New York o\ufb03ce, wrote to the council of the AMS, \u201cThe com-\nmittee used all e\ufb00orts within the dignity of the Society to secure the withdrawal of\nthis resignation, but without success\u201d (T. H. Hildebrandt Papers, Bentley Historical\nLibrary, University of Michigan).\n\nIn November 1934, Seely purchased nearly seventeen acres of land in the village\nof Willseyville in the town of Candor in Tioga County, New York, with the plan to\nretire the following spring. Seely wrote to D. E. Smith in November 1934, \u201cThanks\nvery much for your kind letter; it is nice to feel that my \ufb01rst boss still remembers\nme. Yes, I am leaving the Society\u2019s o\ufb03ce on April 1, to start a chicken farm; my\nfriends tell me this is a very appropriate day for such a move. But most of them\ndon\u2019t know New York State as well as you and I do, and don\u2019t realize how beautiful\nit is up there\u201d (David Eugene Smith Professional Collection).\n\nA year later she wrote to Smith, \u201cIt is lovely up here, and I enjoy being a farmer\nvery much indeed. But it takes some time and money to get a farm in working\norder, and my part time job with the Transactions will run out this spring, with\nthe completion of the \ufb01rst volume for 1936; I should have been glad if it had lasted\na little longer, until my chickens are more steady on their feet. So if you hear of\nany text book work that you think I could handle, I should be glad if you would\nlet me know\u201d (David Eugene Smith Professional Collection).\n\nSeely continued living in Willseyville most of the rest of her life. She died in\n1961 at age seventy-three in a nursing home in nearby Ithaca and was buried in\nWoodland Cemetery in Delhi. She was survived by a niece, a nephew, and cousins.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1912 Re\ufb01nements of the notion of limit prevailing in the modern theory of functions of\na real variable.

She had younger brothers, Edward W. (1916\u20131994)\nand Vaughan (1923\u20132003). Her father graduated from the Massachusetts Institute of Tech-\nnology in 1910 and worked for many years for Western Electric Company in New York\nCity. In 1918 he described his occupation as electrical engineer and in 1930 as accountant.\nMartha Hathaway attended public schools in Montclair and graduated with honors in\nmathematics from the high school there in 1931. She then entered Wellesley College, where\nshe was a Durant scholar and served as president of the Wellesley mathematics club her\nsenior year, 1934\u201335. She graduated with honors in mathematics in 1935. On June 19,\ntwo days after her graduation, Martha Hathaway married Herbert Fitz Randolph Plass\nin Wellesley, Massachusetts. Herbert Plass was born in Newark, New Jersey, in 1912, and\nhe earned bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in physics from the Massachusetts Institute\nof Technology (MIT) in 1934 and 1935, respectively, before entering medical school at\nHarvard University.\n\nMartha H. Plass entered MIT in 1935 and \ufb01nished her work for her master\u2019s degree\na year later, having written a thesis supervised by George Rutledge. She continued at\nMIT, where she minored in physics and where D. J. Struik supervised her doctoral disser-\ntation. During the second semester 1937\u201338 she was an instructor at Wellesley and was\nthe nominee of Wellesley for its institutional membership to the AMS. In the fall of 1938\nshe became an instructor at the University of Maryland. In 1939 Martha Plass received\nher PhD from MIT and Herbert R. Plass received his MD from Harvard; they also were\ndivorced that year.\n\nMartha Plass continued to teach at the University of Maryland as an instructor until\n1940, when she married Jonathan Wilber Williams and moved to North Carolina. Jonathan\nW. Williams was born March 5, 1910, in Olmsted Falls, Ohio. He earned his BS at Baldwin-\nWallace College in 1930 and his MS and PhD in organic chemistry in 1932 and 1935,\nrespectively, from Northwestern University. He taught at a junior college the \ufb01rst two\nyears after receiving his doctorate and was on the faculty at the University of Maryland\n1937\u201339 and at the University of North Carolina 1939\u201341. During the war he worked\nat the US Naval Research Laboratory 1941\u201342 and with the National Defense Research\nCommittee of the O\ufb03ce of Scienti\ufb01c Research and Development 1942\u201345.\n\nMartha Williams was again an instructor at Maryland 1941\u201343. After the war, Jonathan\nWilliams worked for the DuPont chemical company 1946\u201354 and then for the Haskell\nLaboratory of Toxicology and Industrial Medicine, established by DuPont, 1954\u201360. In\n1960 he took a position with the patent and licensing division of the US Department of\nthe Interior.\n\nMartha and Jonathan Williams had two children: a daughter, Susan, born in about\n1943, and a son, Jon M., born about \ufb01ve years later. The family lived in Wilmington,\nDelaware, by the early 1950s. Martha Williams was a member of the Canterbury Garden\nClub and the Delaware Da\ufb00odil Society and was president of the Delaware Federation\nof Garden Clubs 1962\u201365.

Mary Junkin\nBuchanan was born in Ohio; she attended public schools in Allegheny and the Pitts-\nburgh Female College (now Chatham College), from which she received a Mistress\nof English Literature [or Language] degree in 1870. On February 27, 1873, in Al-\nlegheny, Mary Buchanan married John Cowley of Pennsylvania. Mary B. Cowley\nwas a volunteer supervisor of playgrounds in Pittsburgh for most of the \ufb01rst decade\nof the century before being elected supervisor of playgrounds and vacation schools.\nShe was a member of the school board in Pittsburgh and was engaged in other civic\nand cultural activities, some of which are indicated in her entry in Woman\u2019s Who\u2019s\nWho in America 1914\u20131915. In 1900 John Cowley was an auditor; he was deceased\nby 1914.\n\nElizabeth Cowley attended the public schools of Allegheny after which she stud-\nied for two years before receiving a BS degree in 1893 from Indiana Normal School\n(now Indiana University of Pennsylvania). She taught for the next four years in\npublic schools in Pennsylvania and was given a life diploma by the state.\n\nCowley entered Vassar College in September 1897 and received her BA degree\nfour years later. She was awarded the graduate scholarship in mathematics and\nastronomy for the next year and received her MA degree from Vassar in 1902.\nCowley remarked in the vita accompanying her later PhD dissertation, \u201cThrough\nthe courtesy of Professor [Mary W.] Whitney an opportunity was given to me to\nwork out the de\ufb01nitive orbit of a comet. Dr. [Caroline E.] Furness gave valuable\nadvice and Miss [Ida] Whiteside assisted in calculations.\u201d The paper was published\nas 1907d with Whiteside, a fellow graduate student, as coauthor. In 1940 Cowley\nreferred to it as a \u201cPrize Paper\u201d (Owens questionnaire).\n\nIn 1902 Cowley was appointed instructor in mathematics at Vassar and continued\nat that rank until 1913. She attended the summer sessions at the University of\nChicago 1903\u201305, where she had twelve weeks of mathematics and physics each year.\nShe began work at Columbia University during the second semester of the academic\nyear 1905\u201306 and remained for summer school in 1906 and the next academic year,\n1906\u201307. Her doctorate was awarded by Columbia in 1908. She wrote in the vita\naccompanying the dissertation, \u201cI desire to express my gratitude to all my teachers,\nbut especially to Professor Keyser, who is able in an unusual degree to inspire his\nstudents with a hearty enthusiasm for study. To Professor Henry S. White, as head\nof my department at Vassar College, I am indebted for encouragement, criticism,\nand sympathy with my work.\u201d\n\nCowley remained at Vassar, except for leaves of absence, until 1929. She was\nassistant professor 1913\u201316 and associate professor 1916\u201329. While at Vassar she\ncontinued her studies, was active in a number of mathematical societies, and pub-\nlished regularly. She reported in 1914 that she had studied at the universities in\nG\u00a8ottingen and Munich as well as those indicated above. She attended the Interna-\ntional Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) held at Cambridge, England, in 1912. She\nbelonged to two foreign mathematical societies and was a charter member of the\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCOWLEY - 2\n\nMAA. She was particularly active in the MAA during its \ufb01rst decade. She served\non the program committee for the annual meeting at the University of Chicago in\n1917 and was elected to the MAA council to serve January 1918\u2013January 1921.\nHowever, in 1920 the MAA incorporated and she automatically became a mem-\nber of the new board of trustees with a term ending in December 1920. She also\nstood for election to vice president in 1921 and 1925. In addition to contributing\nthe articles and reviews indicated below, Cowley contributed to a number of other\neducational and popular publications, writing on her 1940 questionnaire for Helen\nOwens that she had published 100 articles. She also served on the editorial board\nof the abstracting journal Revue semestrielle des publications math\u00b4ematiques and\nwas a regular reviewer for the journal from 1908 until 1926. Furthermore, among\nthe twenty-four book reviews she published in the Bulletin of the AMS, seventeen\nwere reviews of books written in French, German, Italian, or Spanish.\n\nCowley had a leave of absence from Vassar 1926\u201329 and was promoted to pro-\nfessor while on leave. She resigned her position at Vassar in June 1929 to return to\nPittsburgh to be with her mother. She wrote in 1937 that she \u201ccame to do a special\npiece of work\u201d (Owens questionnaire). She immediately took a teaching position in\na Pittsburgh high school and continued teaching until 1938, near the time of her\nmother\u2019s death. She was active in local professional organizations: she was sponsor\nfor various activities of the Pittsburgh public high schools, she became president of\nthe mathematics section of the Pennsylvania State Education Association in 1934,\nand she was for a time president of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics of\nWestern Pennsylvania.\n\nCowley\u2019s mathematical interests were broad. During the 1920s she published\nand spoke on historical topics. During that period she also studied crystallography\nbecause she had read some work on phases of atomic structure that interested her.\nLater her publications were more in the \ufb01eld of mathematics education, and in\nDecember 1934 she directed a symposium on \u201cMethods of making mathematics\ninteresting\u201d by Pittsburgh teachers at an NCTM meeting held in Pittsburgh at the\nsame time as the annual MAA meeting. She gave many invited talks at schools\nand one to the Central Association of Science and Mathematics Teachers. In 1941\nshe wrote a book about public education in the United States as exempli\ufb01ed by\nMassachusetts, Pennsylvania, Michigan, and California.\n\nIn her entry in the 1914 Woman\u2019s Who\u2019s Who of America, Cowley reported\nthat she was a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution and of the\nNational Plant, Flower and Fruit Guild; that she was in favor of women\u2019s su\ufb00rage;\nand that she enjoyed outdoor sports. In 1940, after she had retired from teaching,\nshe indicated that she was traveling and writing, and that poetry that she had\nwritten had been published.\n\nAt some time after her mother\u2019s death and her own retirement from teaching\nin Pittsburgh, Elizabeth Cowley moved to Fort Lauderdale, Florida. She su\ufb00ered a\nstroke in 1941 that left her unable to speak or use her right side. A newspaper item\nin 1943 described how she had \u201covercome her handicap completely through her\nindomitable spirit and strong determination to carry on.\u201d It then described how,\nwith only her left hand, she was able to keep up her writing and correspondence,\nembroider, weave, and sew; at the time of the article she had made seven large Red\nCross afghans to aid the war e\ufb00ort. Elizabeth Cowley died in her residence in Fort\nLauderdale, Florida, at age seventy in 1945 and was cremated.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCOWLEY - 3\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA (charter member), Circ.

      "text": "GARVIN, Sister Mary Cleophas. December 11, 1899\u2013January 16, 1990.\nFordham University (BS 1927), Saint Louis University (MS 1931, PhD 1934).\n\nSister Mary Cleophas Garvin was born Linetta Anna Garvin in Vickery, Ohio,\nthe daughter of Odelia Margaret (Wilhelm) (1873\u20131962) and Austin Edward Garvin\n(1868\u20131926), natives of Ohio. Her mother was a housewife; her father was a meat\ndealer in 1900, a salesman in a meat market in 1910, and a foreman in an auto\nfactory, Willys-Overland Company, in Toledo, Ohio, in 1920. She had one older\nsister, Lucille (1898\u20131923), and four younger brothers: Paul J. (1901\u20131986), Austin\nE. (1902\u20131986), Norbert J. (1904\u20131979), and Cleophus (1910\u20131914).\n\nGarvin attended grade school at St. Ann\u2019s and high school at Notre Dame Acad-\nemy, both in Toledo. She graduated from high school in May 1917 and entered the\nCongregation of the Sisters of Notre Dame in Cleveland, Ohio, on July 2, 1917.\nHer investment was on January 2, 1918, her \ufb01rst vows on January 2, 1920, and her\n\ufb01nal vows on January 1, 1923, in Cleveland. Her religious name, Mary Cleophas,\nwas chosen in memory of her brother who died at age four when she was eleven.\n\nGarvin was an instructor in mathematics and physics, as well as religion, history,\nand Latin, at Notre Dame High School in Cleveland from 1919 to 1929. While teach-\ning full time, she spent eight years in part-time study completing her undergraduate\nwork in science, mathematics, and education. She had extension courses at Notre\nDame College and John Carroll University in Cleveland and summer courses at\nSt. Xavier College (now Xavier University) in Cincinnati, Catholic Sisters College\nof the Catholic University of America, University of Notre Dame, and Fordham\nUniversity.\n\nAfter receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree from Fordham in 1927, Sister Mary Cleo-\nphas taught for two more years at Notre Dame High School. She had courses in\nFrench and education at Fordham in the summer of 1928 and courses in education\nat Columbia University in the summer of 1929. In autumn 1929 she entered Saint\nLouis University for full-time graduate study. She spent the next \ufb01ve years there and\nearned a master\u2019s degree in 1931 and a PhD in 1934 with studies in mathematics,\nphysics, and astronomy. Her doctoral dissertation in analysis was written under the\ndirection of Francis Regan, who had earned his PhD from Michigan in 1932. She was\nRegan\u2019s \ufb01rst doctoral student and the second to receive a PhD in mathematics from\nSaint Louis University. The published version of her dissertation appeared in the\nAmerican Journal of Mathematics, and her results were extended in 1938 and 1944\nby Regan\u2019s next two students, Rev. William C. Doyle and Ella C. Marth, whose\ndissertations appeared in the Annals of Mathematics and the Duke Mathematical\nJournal, respectively.\n\nImmediately after receiving her doctorate, Sister Mary Cleophas returned to the\nCleveland area to serve as professor of mathematics and physics and head of the\nscience department at Notre Dame College. This college, a\ufb03liated with the Sisters\nof Notre Dame and then primarily for women, awarded its \ufb01rst bachelor\u2019s degree\nin 1926. Garvin remained as department head until her retirement in about 1976.\nShe taught until 1975, was chairman of the computer center 1975\u201376, and was\nassociated with the computer center until 1977. She also served as superior at the\ncollege 1947\u201353 and 1958\u201360.\n\nSister Mary Cleophas continued to take or audit courses. These included courses\nin religion and physics at John Carroll University and courses in mathematics at\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGARVIN - 2\n\nOklahoma State University (NSF institute, summer 1959); the University of Kansas\n(summer 1960); and Bowdoin College (summers 1961, 1962). She audited other\ncourses at the University of Oklahoma and at Seton Hall University.\n\nAmong her contributions at the college, besides what was described as her \u201cun-\nusual talent for teaching,\u201d were special classes for parents to learn the \u201cnew math\u201d\nwith their children (\u201cSister Mary Cleophas: An Educator,\u201d 1). She provided ele-\nmentary and secondary teachers with information about curricular changes, and\nintroduced computer science to teachers and college students. In connection with\nher interest in computer science, in the late 1960s and early 1970s Sister Mary\nCleophas applied for and received several grants for desktop computers and for\ncomputer-related workshops and institutes, especially for teachers. She also gave\ntalks at meetings of NCTM. During her last few years at Notre Dame College her\nactivities were focused mainly on the computer center. The Garvin Computing\nCenter at Notre Dame College is named after her.\n\nIn addition to her professional a\ufb03liations with national mathematics and physics\nassociations, Garvin was also a member of the Central Association of Science and\nMathematics Teachers. In 1975 she was made an emeritus member of the Ohio\nCouncil of Teachers of Mathematics; in 1976 she was presented with a life member-\nship.\n\nGarvin\u2019s main intellectual interest outside of mathematics was music. A 1981\narticle quoted her as saying, \u201cAlthough mathematics was my \ufb01rst interest, music\nwas a close second. Rarely did I miss an opportunity to attend a good musical\nprogram, especially of the Cleveland Orchestra\u201d (\u201cKeeping in Touch \u2013 Sister Mary\nCleophas\u201d).\n\nExcerpts from the obituary that appeared in the Notre Dame College of Ohio\n\nToday emphasize yet another aspect of her life.\n\nSister Mary Cleophas was ever concerned for the needy and the\npoor. In the early years of the college, she served as \ufb01nancial aid\nadvisor for needy students. . . .\n\nShe was a charter promoter of the Servants of the Paraclete,\ngathering stipends, food, and clothing for needy priests who had\nleft the active ministry . . . . On Sundays she visited the lonely in a\nnursing home . . . .\n\nAs the time for retirement from the classroom drew near, her\noutreach to the needy increased as she organized the distribution\nof bread to the hungry, new and used clothing to the needy, bed\nlinens to the poor, and vitamins to the malnourished. To assure the\ncontinuation of this work, she founded the Cleveland Co-Workers\nof Mother Teresa, a group of 35 men and women who are dedicated\nto helping the lonely, the unwanted, and the poor. (p. 1)\n\nSister Mary Cleophas received the Vincent P. Haas Memorial Award for \u201cputting\nGospel values in action\u201d and the Mayor\u2019s Award for volunteerism in 1985.\n\nAfter her retirement, Sister Mary Cleophas remained at the college as archivist\nbefore moving to the Provincial House in Chardon, Ohio, in 1985. She died of\npneumonia in the Provincial House Health Care Center in 1990, shortly after a\ncelebration of her ninetieth birthday.

      "text": "HUGHES, Olive Margaret. December 13, 1899\u2013December 29, 1936.\nUniversity of Saskatchewan (BA 1925, MA 1926), Bryn Mawr College (PhD\n1934).\n\nOlive Margaret Hughes was the daughter of Martha (Rogers) (1863\u20131948) and\nDaniel Hughes (1860\u20131930), both originally from farm families in Wales. By 1886,\nwhen their \ufb01rst child, Eleanor (1886\u20131960), was born, they had a dairy shop in\nLondon and lived there during the nearly twenty-year span when their eleven chil-\ndren were born. Olive was born in London, the ninth in the family where, after the\n\ufb01rst girl, there were \ufb01ve boys followed by \ufb01ve girls. The other children were Richard\n(1888\u20131958), William (ca. 1891\u20131947), (Daniel) Oscar (1892\u20131965), Vernon Austin\n(1893\u20131970), Lewis Maurice (1894\u20131957), Blodwen (Dolly) (1896\u20131911), Winifred\n(1898\u20131967), Norah (b. 1902), and Kathleen (1905\u20131969).\n\nThe family migration to Canada began in 1905 when the eldest son arrived in\nwestern Saskatchewan, near Maidstone. Most other family members followed during\nthe next several years including the father and another son in 1908; the mother and\nyoungest daughter, Kathleen, in 1909; and \ufb01nally the eldest daughter, Eleanor,\nwith Winifred, Olive, and Norah in 1912. The Hughes family farmed in western\nSaskatchewan after their emigration from England.\n\nOlive Hughes began her education in London. After her arrival in Canada at age\ntwelve, she attended the Dee Valley School, a one-room school house some distance\nfrom their farm. According to a 1984 account by her younger sister Norah Dodds\nin a local history, \u201cMother was getting a little worried because our attendance at\nDee Valley School was very irregular due to poor roads and bad weather\u201d (Chain\nof Memories, 80). Thus, in 1914, their mother rented a small house in North Bat-\ntleford, about \ufb01fty miles away, so the four youngest girls could attend school there.\nOlive attended grades nine through eleven before teaching in the fall of 1917 at the\nDee Valley School with a permit from Regina, the provincial capital.\n\nHughes \ufb01nished grade twelve in North Battleford and apparently attended Nor-\nmal School in Saskatoon and then taught. She entered the University of Saskatch-\newan, also in Saskatoon, in the fall of 1921 at age twenty-one and specialized in\nmathematics under the direction of G. H. Ling and L. L. Dines. She completed\nthe standard three-year course in 1925, having taken o\ufb00 the year 1922\u201323. She was\ngranted a BA with high honors in mathematics in 1925. She was vice president and\npresident, respectively, of the university mathematical society during her last two\nyears as an undergraduate, and was an assistant in the department her last year.\nThe summer following her graduation, she studied mathematics at the University of\nChicago and then returned to the University of Saskatchewan as a graduate student\nand assistant in the mathematics department. She received her master\u2019s degree in\n1926.\n\nHughes remained at the university the next two years as an instructor and served\nas the faculty advisor to the mathematical society at least in 1927\u201328. She studied\nmathematics at the University of Chicago again during the summer of 1927.\n\nOlive Hughes\u2019s enrollment at the University of Saskatchewan overlapped with\nthat of her next older sister Winifred, who earned a BA with honors in biology\nin 1922 and an MA in 1924. Winifred Hughes earned a PhD in biology from the\nUniversity of Chicago in 1929 and subsequently was professor of zoology at the\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHUGHES - 2\n\nUniversity of Alberta. Apparently these were the only Hughes children to receive\nregular university degrees.\n\nOlive Hughes left her instructorship at the University of Saskatchewan at the\nend of the academic year 1927\u201328 to accept a fellowship at Bryn Mawr College. She\nstudied at Bryn Mawr 1928\u201331, the \ufb01rst two years as a resident fellow. She took\nmathematics as her major subject and physics as her independent minor. Her PhD\nwas granted in 1934, with her dissertation having been completed in 1931 under\nthe direction of Anna Pell Wheeler.\n\nAccording to the Bryn Mawr College 1934 commencement program, Hughes was\nprincipal of the Islay School District in Alberta, Canada, 1931\u201334. Records supplied\nby Allen Ronaghan, a Canadian historian associated with the museum of the school\nin Islay, indicate that she was there 1932\u201334, and that she taught grades seven\nthrough ten in one room of the two-room school. Mr. Ronaghan contacted three of\nher former students who commented on some aspects of her teaching at Islay. Their\nremarks included that she was \u201cvery intellectual,\u201d \u201cvery well prepared as a teacher,\u201d\n\u201ckept to herself and did not go out into the community,\u201d \u201csmoked cigarettes in\nsecret,\u201d \u201cread many books,\u201d and \u201cstayed at school late, either preparing her class\nwork or reading her own assignments.\u201d\n\nIt is unclear what Hughes did after receiving her PhD in 1934, although Bryn\nMawr records show that she was residing on East Chestnut Street in Chicago,\nIllinois, in 1935. It is possible that she was with her sister Kathleen Hughes, who\nwas working as a commercial artist in Chicago at that time according to the Hughes\nentry in Chain of Memories. Many years after Olive Hughes\u2019s death, a 1950 Bryn\nMawr directory listed her address as in care of her sister Winifred in Edmonton,\nAlberta, about 135 miles west of her last con\ufb01rmed address in Islay.\n\nAn extensive search for information about the date, place, and cause of her death\nhas resulted only in the following, written by her sister Norah: \u201cHer untimely demise\nin 1936 was due to a bus-train collision\u201d (Chain of Memories, 83).

      "text": "LITTLE, Dorothy (Manning) Smiley. October 6, 1909\u2013October 18, 1988.\nStanford University (BA 1933, MA 1934, PhD 1937).\n\nDorothy Manning was the eldest of \ufb01ve surviving children of Esther Mae (Cran-\ndall) (1883\u20131954), originally from San Francisco, California, and William Albert\nManning (1876\u20131972), born in Salem, Oregon. Esther Crandall earned a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in 1903 and a master\u2019s degree in 1905 in Greek from Stanford and was a PhD\nstudent in psychology there at the time of her marriage in 1908. W. A. Manning\nspent a year in Nicaragua with a half-brother before beginning his undergraduate\nstudies. He earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1900 from Willamette University in Salem,\nOregon, and a master\u2019s degree in 1902 and a PhD in 1904 in mathematics from\nStanford University. He studied at the Sorbonne during the year 1904\u201305 and then\nreturned to the mathematics department at Stanford where, except for a visiting\nposition, he spent the remainder of his career.\n\nEsther Crandall and W. A. Manning were married on September 18, 1908, and\nmade their home in Palo Alto. He had a visiting position at the University of\nIllinois in 1909\u201310, and it was in Champaign, Illinois, that Dorothy Manning was\nborn. There were three more daughters: Rhoda (1912\u20132006), Helena (1914\u20131939),\nand Sylvia (1917\u20132005). Twin boys were born in 1920 but died shortly after birth.\nThe surviving son, Laurence Albert, was born in 1923. The family moved from Palo\nAlto to the Stanford campus, an unincorporated area, in 1925.\n\nDorothy Manning attended public schools in Palo Alto and graduated in 1928\nfrom Palo Alto Union High School. She entered Stanford in the fall of 1928, the\nyear Marie Weiss received her doctorate in group theory as a student of W. A.\nManning. Dorothy Manning was registered for two quarters in each of the last two\nof her \ufb01ve years as an undergraduate at Stanford and received her BA with great\ndistinction as a chemistry major in April 1933. The following year she completed\nthe work for her MA in mathematics, with a thesis in group theory written under\nthe direction of her father. One year later, in June 1935, her PhD dissertation in\ngroup theory was approved by W. A. Manning and H. F. Blichfeldt, and, for the\ncommittee on graduate study, Ralph H. Lutz. Her dissertation, written under her\nfather\u2019s direction, appeared in the Transactions of the AMS in 1936, the year before\nher degree was granted with a minor in chemistry. During the academic years 1935\u2013\n36 and 1936\u201337 Dorothy Manning was an Abraham Rosenberg research fellow at\nStanford.\n\nDorothy Manning\u2019s four siblings all attended Stanford. Rhoda entered in the fall\nof 1929 and Helena in the fall of 1931. Both studied mathematics and earned BA\u2019s\nin 1935 and MA\u2019s in 1937. Like their older sister, both wrote master\u2019s theses under\nthe direction of their father. Helena died of sleeping sickness in November 1939\nafter an illness of about a year and a half. Rhoda continued her work at Stanford\nand earned a PhD in mathematics in 1941 under the direction of Gabor Szeg\u00a8o. She\nwas for some time on the faculty at Oregon State University, where she met and\nmarried William H. Wood, a geologist. Sylvia Manning \ufb01rst enrolled at Stanford in\nthe fall of 1935 and studied chemistry for three years. Laurence Manning entered\nStanford in 1940 and earned all his degrees in electrical engineering: a BA in 1944,\nan MS in 1947, and a PhD in 1949. He became a professor of electrical engineering\nat Stanford.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLITTLE - 2\n\nDorothy Manning studied at the University of Chicago 1937\u201338 as a holder of\na prestigious National Research Fellowship; the following year she was a member\nof the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton. In the fall of 1939 she became\nan instructor at Wells College in Aurora, New York, and resigned after two years.\nThe notice of her resignation appeared in the August 1941 Monthly and included\nthe information that she \u201chas become the bride of Dr. M. F. Smiley of Lehigh\nUniversity\u201d (48:489).\n\nOn August 20, 1941, Dorothy Manning and Malcolm Finlay Smiley were married\nin Chicago. Smiley was born near Monmouth, Illinois, on December 15, 1912. He\ndid all of his work through the doctorate at the University of Chicago; he earned a\nBS with honors in 1934, an MS in 1935, and a PhD in 1937, with a dissertation in\nthe calculus of variations. He was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study\nin 1937\u201338. In 1938 he went to Lehigh University as instructor and was promoted\nto assistant professor before he left in 1942. He also taught as a visiting faculty\nmember at Chicago for the summers of 1939 and 1941. There were no children of\nthe marriage.\n\nDorothy Manning Smiley had no formal employment after her marriage, but M.\nF. Smiley was associated with a number of institutions. During World War II he\nwas in the US Naval Reserve and taught at the Post Graduate School of the US\nNaval Academy. He returned to Lehigh as associate professor brie\ufb02y after the war.\nHe was at Northwestern University 1946\u201348, at the University of Iowa 1948\u201360, at\nthe University of California at Riverside 1960\u201367, and at SUNY Albany from 1967\nuntil his retirement in about 1980 or 1981. In 1954\u201355, he was a faculty fellow of the\nFund for the Advancement of Education, and in 1975 he was an honorary research\nassociate at Harvard. The focus of his research shifted from analysis to abstract\nalgebra.\n\nDorothy Manning Smiley had earlier been elected to Phi Beta Kappa and was\na member of Sigma Xi, a science honor society; Iota Sigma Pi, a chemistry honor\nsociety for women; and Sigma Delta Epsilon, an organization for graduate women\nin science. Long after her marriage she coauthored two mathematical papers, which\nappeared in the Monthly in 1964 and 1965. In a paper that appeared in the Trans-\nactions of the AMS in 1957, M. F. Smiley wrote, \u201cIt is with pleasure that the\nauthor acknowledges that certain conversations with his wife, Dorothy M. Smiley,\naided materially in the derivation of the results given in this note\u201d (84:426). He also\nacknowledged her \u201chelpful suggestions\u201d in a 1968 paper in the Proceedings of the\nAMS (19:1029, footnote). Dorothy Smiley retained her membership in AMS until\nthe mid-1970s.\n\nIn a December 1997 e-mail to one of the authors, Dorothy Smiley was described\nby her brother, Laurence Manning, as \u201cthe smallest of her siblings (at 5\u20195\u201d), and\nlight boned.\u201d He noted that she \u201chad a quiet orderly personality.\u201d He said that \u201cshe\nspoke quietly but very intelligently. She studied the violin as a child, but wasn\u2019t\nvery good at it.\u201d He recalled, \u201cDorothy was 12 years older than I was, so during\nthe time that we were at home together I was quite young. I used to look to her as\nequivalent to an encyclopedia. She seemed to know a lot about many things. My\nown interest in radio and electronics can probably be traced back to the seed that\nshe planted by constructing our family\u2019s \ufb01rst radio. I remember hearing a bit of\nPresident Herbert Hoover\u2019s inauguration on her set.\u201d\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLITTLE - 3\n\nThe Smileys had several moves into new communities, but Dorothy Smiley\u2019s\nbrother reported that, \u201cshe always got involved in local activities, usually quickly\ngetting a position on some board or other.\u201d She also liked to paint, \u201cand her pictures\nwere carefully done, and most likely still lifes.\u201d\n\nAfter 1967 the Smileys lived in the Albany area, and it was there that Malcolm\nF. Smiley died in July 1982, shortly after his retirement. After his death Dorothy\nManning Smiley moved from her home to an apartment. Later she met Jess Edward\nLittle, a retired chemist. On March 26, 1988, they were married in a Unitarian\nChurch to which they both had connections. Less than seven months later, on\nOctober 18, Dorothy Manning Smiley Little died suddenly after su\ufb00ering a massive\nheart attack at their home in Slingerland, New York.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Sigma Delta Epsilon, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma\nXi.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1934 [Manning, D.] Concerning simply transitive groups of degree n that contain circular\npermutations of the n letters.

August 4, 1903\u2013September 27, 1958.\nUniversity of Georgia (BA 1924, MA 1928), University of Illinois (PhD 1934).\n\nGertrude Stith was born near Nunez, Georgia, the eldest of \ufb01ve surviving children\nof Louella (Jones) (b. ca. 1882) and John R. Stith (b. 1862), a farmer. Her mother\nwas a native of Georgia and her father of North Carolina. At the time of the 1910\ncensus, her mother was twenty-eight, had been married for eight years, and had\nthree surviving children of four born. These were Gertrude, age six; Estelle, age \ufb01ve;\nand Mabelle, age four. Her father was forty-eight, had been married previously, and\nhad a step-daughter, a son, and two daughters from a previous marriage. Gertrude\nStith\u2019s parents had two children after 1910: Pauline, born in about 1913 and John\nin about 1921. Neither of the parents had an advanced education.\n\nA school superintendent who boarded with the family was an inspiration to\nGertrude Stith, who was the \ufb01rst of her siblings to go to college. Immediately after\ngraduating from the University of Georgia, Stith began teaching in high schools in\nGeorgia. She taught in Hawkinsville 1924\u201325 and in Athens 1925\u201328. In 1928 she\nalso completed her work for her master\u2019s degree at the University of Georgia.\n\nFrom 1928 to 1930 Stith was a student assistant in the mathematics depart-\nment at Brown University. She borrowed money from a local bank to \ufb01nance her\nstudies there; nevertheless, she was unable to continue at Brown for \ufb01nancial rea-\nsons. However, she was able to continue her graduate education after obtaining an\nassistantship at the University of Illinois for the year 1930\u201331.\n\nAfter a year at Illinois, on July 6, 1931, Gertrude Stith married Pierce Waddell\nKetchum, a member of the mathematics faculty. Ketchum, born September 5, 1903,\nin Salt Lake City, had earned his bachelor\u2019s degree in 1922 from the University of\nUtah and his master\u2019s degree in 1923 and doctorate in 1926 from the University of\nIllinois. Except for periods away as a member of the Institute of Advanced Study\nin 1937\u201338, a fellow and visiting lecturer at Brown 1942\u201343, and as head of the\nanalysis section of a gunnery school with the US Air Force 1944\u201345, he spent his\ncareer in the mathematics department at Illinois: as instructor 1926\u201328, associate\n1928\u201337, assistant professor 1937\u201342, associate professor 1942\u201347, professor 1947\u2013\n69, and professor emeritus after his retirement in 1969.\n\nBecause of anti-nepotism rules, Gertrude Stith Ketchum could not continue as\na teaching assistant after her marriage. Although she was not allowed to teach,\nGertrude Ketchum was allowed to continue as a graduate student, which she did\nfor the year 1931\u201332. Their \ufb01rst child, Pierce Stith, was born in June 1933, after\nwhich Gertrude Ketchum resumed her studies in 1933\u201334, \ufb01nished her dissertation\nin analysis under the direction of R. D. Carmichael, and received her PhD in 1934\nwith a minor in English. The following April 1935, their daughter, Laura Stith, was\nborn. In a 1937 letter to Helen Owens about the summer meetings in State College,\nPennsylvania, Ketchum noted her appreciation for the provision of entertainment\nfor small children.\n\nGertrude Ketchum had two publications in mathematics, one based on her dis-\nsertation, which was published in 1936 in the Transactions of the AMS and was\ncited by other mathematicians into the early 1940s, and one a few years later that\nwas coauthored with her husband. She continued her involvement in mathematics\nby proposing and solving problems that appeared in the American Mathematical\nMonthly and the National Mathematics Magazine at least through 1941. In 1983\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nKETCHUM - 2\n\nher husband said that she was hurt by not being able to teach when they \ufb01rst\nmarried but that some years later she was able to teach part time.\n\nGertrude Ketchum had always been active and athletic with a particular interest\nin riding. In high school she had organized a girls\u2019 basketball team. At the University\nof Georgia she had been president of the university chapter of the YWCA, captain\nof the ri\ufb02e team, and had ridden in university horse shows. Later she used her\nexpertise in horsemanship as an instructor of equitation for \ufb01ve years at riding\ncamps for girls.\n\nIn 1952 Gertrude Ketchum became ill with cirrhosis of the liver and died at\nhome in Urbana six years later at age \ufb01fty-\ufb01ve. She was cremated and her remains\ninterred at Fairlawn Cemetery in Decatur, Illinois. In 1961, three years after her\ndeath, P. W.

She was the seventh of eight children, with older siblings Alice\n(b. 1883), Merry Lewis (1884\u20131966), Kate (b. 1886), Christina (b. 1887), Mary (b.\n1889), and Edgar (b. 1891), and younger brother, Robert (1898\u20131954). Her father,\nMerry Lewis Pence, graduated in 1881 from what was then the Agricultural and\nMechanical College of Kentucky, and earned a master\u2019s degree in 1885. He joined the\nNew York Mathematical Society in 1891 and remained a member through at least\n1894 when it became the American Mathematical Society. He taught for over \ufb01fty\nyears and for nearly forty years served at what eventually became the University\nof Kentucky, \ufb01rst as professor of civil engineering and physics and then as head of\nthe physics department that he established. Pence Hall on the campus is named for\nhim. The university gives the Merry Lewis Pence Award for the outstanding senior\nphysics major annually.

Upon receiving that degree\nin 1928 Pence became an instructor at Murray Normal School and Teachers College\n(now Murray State University) in Kentucky. The following year she was hired as\nan instructor at the University of Kentucky, where, except for leaves, she spent the\nremainder of her career.\n\nWhile teaching at Kentucky, Pence continued taking mathematics courses there\nbefore attending Cornell University during the summers of 1932 and 1933. Virgil\nSnyder, from whom she took courses both summers, described her as \u201ca very good\nstudent\u201d at the end of the \ufb01rst and \u201can excellent student\u201d at the end of the second\n(Cornell University Graduate School Files). Pence took a leave of absence from\nKentucky to attend the University of Illinois 1934\u201335. She was an assistant in\nmathematics at Illinois in 1935\u201336, remained for the summer, and returned for the\nsecond semester of 1936\u201337 to complete the work for her PhD. Her major \ufb01eld was\ngeometry with a minor in astronomy.\n\nIn 1938, a year after receiving her doctorate, Pence was promoted to assistant\nprofessor at Kentucky. She was promoted to associate professor in 1947, served as\nchairman of the division of physical science 1954\u201355, and was promoted to professor\nin 1956, seven years before her retirement in 1963. While at Kentucky, Pence was\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nPENCE - 2\n\nactive in professional organizations, particularly the MAA. She was secretary of\nthe Kentucky Section 1947\u201349 and chairman of the section 1953\u201354; she was o\ufb03cial\nMAA lecturer to Kentucky high schools in 1958\u201359 and was executive director of\nthe MAA high school lecture program under the sponsorship of the National Science\nFoundation 1962\u201363. In 1957 Pence directed a summer seminar for in-service high\nschool mathematics teachers. Pence was also executive director of the University of\nKentucky high school honors examinations in mathematics 1959\u201363.\n\nImmediately after her retirement in 1963 Pence headed for Europe with a friend\nfor a four-month trip to Britain, France, Switzerland, Greece, and \ufb01nally Turkey,\nwhere she was to be entertained by the parents of one of her students. Pence did\nsome part-time teaching at the University of Kentucky after her retirement, and\nfrom 1964 until 1966 she was professor at East Carolina College (now East Carolina\nUniversity) in Greenville, North Carolina. She was a visiting distinguished professor\nthere 1966\u201367.\n\nPence had a number of interests and appeared to excel in each. These included\ngolf, philately, photography, and travel. She belonged to the Winchester, Kentucky,\nCountry Club and the Henry Clay Philatelic Society, the latter of which awarded\nher \ufb01rst place for having the best stamp collection among its members in 1939.\nShe was a member of the Lexington Camera Club, was described as an expert\nphotographer, and was frequently invited to give slide presentations and talks to\nvarious clubs and professional groups about her travels. She was a member of the\nLexington Business and Professional Women\u2019s Club, the Woman\u2019s Club of Central\nKentucky, the Kentucky Archaeological Society, the Order of the Eastern Star, and\nthe Daughters of the American Revolution, among others. She was also active in\nthe Calvary Baptist Church, was a member of the Business Women\u2019s Missionary\nCircle, and described herself as a Democrat.\n\nSallie Pence died at the age of ninety-\ufb01ve at the Sayre Christian Village Nursing\nHome in Lexington. She was survived by several nieces and nephews.

      "text": "HALLER, Mary E. June 15, 1901\u2013June 16, 1970.\nUniversity of Washington (BA 1924, MS 1931, PhD 1934).\n\nMary Elizabeth Haller was born in Cumberland, Maryland, the second of at least\nfour daughters of Winifred (Buckey) (b. 1875) and William Henry Haller (b. 1875),\nboth of Maryland. Her elder sister, Elsie C., was three years older than she; her\nyounger sisters were Isabella, about three years younger, and Winifred R., about\neight years younger. Her father worked for the railroad, as a clerk in 1900 and as a\ntelegraph operator in 1910.\n\nHaller attended public schools in Cumberland, Maryland, and graduated from\nAllegany County High School in 1916. The next two years she was enrolled in\nthe Frostburg State Normal School (now Frostburg State University) in Frostburg,\nMaryland, from which she graduated in 1918. She taught in elementary schools for\nthe next \ufb01ve years. She was an instructor in the public schools in Maryland 1918\u201320\nand in Renton, Washington, 1920\u201323. While teaching in Renton, near Seattle, she\nattended the University of Washington and in 1924 earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in\neducation with a major in mathematics and a minor in economics. The next \ufb01ve\nyears, 1924\u201329, Haller taught in the high school in Renton and, after successfully\nteaching and demonstrating professional growth, earned the Washington State Life\nDiploma.\n\nIn 1929 Haller returned to the University of Washington, where she was a teach-\ning fellow in the mathematics department 1929\u201331 while she worked toward her\n1931 master\u2019s degree with a thesis in projective geometry and a minor in physics.\nWhile continuing her graduate work at the University of Washington she was an\nassociate in mathematics 1931\u201334 and a Loretta Denny fellow 1933\u201334. She re-\nceived her PhD in 1934 with a minor in physics and with a doctoral dissertation\nin algebraic geometry directed by R. M. Winger, who also directed her master\u2019s\nthesis.\n\nIn 1934\u201335 Haller was professor and dean of women at Gooding College in Idaho.\nAt the time she was there the college was under pressure to o\ufb00er non-academic\nsubjects; it closed three years later. It appears that she studied at the University\nof Chicago in the summer of 1935. After her year at Gooding, Haller returned to\nthe University of Washington where she was instructor 1935\u201341, assistant professor\n1941\u201349, associate professor 1949\u201365, and associate professor emeritus after her\nretirement in December 1965. Haller was among fourteen faculty members whose\nteaching was recognized in \u201cClass Acts\u201d in the September 1999 issue of Columns,\nthe University of Washington alumni magazine. A tribute from a student describes\nhis experience in about 1947:\n\nThe \u201cDoc,\u201d as she was known, had a reputation for working stu-\ndents to death and I was more than apprehensive about attending\nher lectures.\n\nAbout 20 students arrived at the \ufb01rst scheduled class meeting . . .\nAll of a sudden, here comes an imposing \ufb01gure of a woman without\nthe least bit of friendliness on her face. She wrote her name on the\nblackboard, turned to the class and said in \ufb01rm tones, \u201cMy name\nis Dr. Mary Haller and I want you to be advised right now that all\nof you will do twice as much work as any other class, you will not\nmiss a class unless you are near death, if you even drop a pencil\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHALLER - 2\n\nduring one of my lectures, you might as well transfer to another\nclass. Now, those of you who don\u2019t like my terms are free to go\nwithout prejudice.\u201d\n\nAt the end of her announcement, at least 10 of the assembled\ngroup left the room without even a glance to see who was crazy\nenough to remain. When the door to the classroom \ufb01nally closed,\n\u201cDoc\u201d turned to us and with a great big smile said, \u201cNow that\nwe\u2019ve ridden ourselves of the quitters, let\u2019s get started. I assure all\nof you that surviving this class will be a feather in your cap, and you\nwill become good engineers.\u201d True to her word, our class became\nas one and lifelong friendships started. (House, \u201cClass Acts: Mary\nHaller\u201d)\n\nIn 1945 Haller\u2019s signature was one of eighteen on a petition asking for the forma-\ntion of the Paci\ufb01c Northwest Section of the MAA, and during the 1950s she attended\nmany of the section meetings. Her continued interest in physics was demonstrated\nthe summer before her promotion to associate professor when Haller attended a\nthree-day symposium on electro-magnetic theory at MIT that was sponsored by\nthe AMS, the American Institute of Electrical Engineers, the American Institute\nof Physics, and the Institute of Radio Engineers.\n\nIn addition to the organizational a\ufb03liations listed below, Haller belonged to Zeta\nMu Tau, a local mathematics honor society; Sigma Pi Sigma, a national physics\nhonor society; and Pi Lambda Theta, a national honor and professional association\nin education. She was also a member of the American Society for Engineering\nEducation. She was a Methodist and a member of the Wesley Club and Kappa Phi,\na club for Christian university women.\n\nHaller remained in Seattle after her retirement and died as a consequence of\nheart disease at Swedish Hospital in Seattle in 1970, the day after her sixty-ninth\nbirthday.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, AAUW, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, Pi Mu\nEpsilon.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1931 Sextics invariant under the icosahedral group and its sub-group the dihedral group\nof order ten.

May 5, 1858\u2013April 29, 1946.\nOberlin College (BA 1894), Dartmouth College (MA 1911), Syracuse Univer-\nsity (PhD 1918).\n\nJosephine Alberta Robinson was born in Meredith, New Hampshire, the daugh-\nter of Frances Eliza (Weld) (1831\u20131906), a native of Maine, and Joseph Wadleigh\nRobinson (1817\u20131886) of New Hampshire, a farmer. The marriage in 1852 was\nthe second for her father. She had two older sisters and four younger brothers.\nHer siblings were: Helen Augusta (1854\u20131932), Emma Jane (1856\u20131864), Francis\nJoseph (1864\u20131935), Maurice Henry (1865\u20131946), Charles Frederick (1866\u20131932),\nand George Washington (b. 1872). Her three youngest brothers all attended Dart-\nmouth College; Maurice Henry and Charles Frederick graduated in 1890, and George\nWashington transferred to Harvard after his sophomore year. Maurice Henry Robin-\nson became an economist and spent most of his career at the University of Illinois\nafter earning a PhD from Yale in 1902. Charles Frederick Robinson became a Con-\ngregational minister and, after his retirement, taught at Boston University. George\nWashington Robinson became an author and was secretary of the Harvard Graduate\nSchool of Arts and Sciences 1904\u201328.\n\nJosephine Robinson did her secondary work at the New Hampton Literary In-\nstitution, a few miles west of Meredith. She entered in November 1873, did the\nEnglish course, and graduated in 1880, having completed both the commercial and\nthe regular courses. She taught for more than a decade in New Hampshire schools\nbefore entering college. Her early teaching positions included: teacher in New Hamp-\nshire public district schools for about \ufb01fteen months; principal of the high school in\nLaconia 1880\u201382; and teacher, 1882\u201389, and preceptress, 1889\u201390, New Hampton\nLiterary Institution and Commercial College.\n\nRobinson entered Oberlin College at age thirty-two in 1890 and graduated four\nyears later having done her major studies in mathematics. While at Oberlin, she was\na leading member of a literary society, and \u201c. . . her productions were acknowledged\nto be superior in thought and execution and in debate she was irresistible\u201d (Berea\nCollege Archives). She was also a member of the First Congregational Church in\nOberlin.\n\nAfter graduating from Oberlin, Robinson was preceptress (instructor) at Kimball\nUnion Academy in Meriden, New Hampshire, 1894\u201397, where her main duty was\nteaching Latin. She had been engaged in postgraduate work at Oberlin in Latin and\nGerman education when she was \u201ccalled\u201d to Berea College in Kentucky in 1897.\nUpon her arrival at Berea she taught Latin (Livy and Caesar), English literature,\nand mathematics. At Berea she was principal of the Ladies Department and act-\ning professor of mathematics 1897\u20131901, dean of women 1901\u201307, and professor of\nmathematics 1901\u201311. During her tenure at Berea, the mathematics courses o\ufb00ered\nby Robinson and her colleagues, all of whom were male, were Arithmetic I, II, III;\nAlgebra; Geometry; Trigonometry; Surveying; and Navigation. During the summers\nof 1907 to 1910 she studied at Dartmouth College and received a master\u2019s degree\nin mathematics in June 1911.\n\nOn February 1, 1911, in Berea, Kentucky, Josephine Robinson married Edward\nDrake Roe, Jr., a widower and mathematics professor at Syracuse University. E.\nD. Roe was born in Elmira, New York, on January 4, 1859. He earned bachelor\u2019s\ndegrees from Syracuse in 1880 and Harvard in 1885 and a master\u2019s degree from\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nROE - 2\n\nHarvard in 1886. He married Harriet Adelaide Bridge Gourley in 1890 and shortly\nthereafter adopted her daughter, Mary Eva Gourley (b. 1879). After teaching at\nHarvard and at Boston University, he went to Oberlin College as associate professor\nof mathematics in 1892, when Josephine Robinson was in her third year there. He\nwas granted a leave 1897\u201399, studied at Erlangen 1897\u201398, and received a PhD from\nthere in 1898 having worked with Paul Gordan. His \ufb01rst wife died in 1898, and he\nremained on the faculty at Oberlin until the end of his leave in 1899. E. D. Roe was\non the faculty at Syracuse University from 1900 until his death twenty-nine years\nlater. In 1901 he was appointed to the John Raymond French chair of mathematics,\nand in 1919 he was appointed director of the Holden Observatory at Syracuse; he\nalso served as head of the mathematics department. He built a private observatory\nat his home and was the founder of the national honorary mathematics society Pi\nMu Epsilon in 1914.\n\nAfter her marriage in February 1911, Josephine Robinson Roe left Berea College\nand moved to Syracuse, where she subsequently engaged in graduate studies in\nmathematics. In 1918, at age sixty, she received a PhD from Syracuse University\nwith a dissertation that she began with the statement: \u201cThis investigation is a\ncontinuation of published work of Professor E.D. Roe, Jr., to whom I am greatly\nindebted for assistance and advice.\u201d She taught as assistant professor at Syracuse\nin 1920; when she joined the MAA in 1934 she listed herself as assistant professor,\nretired. E. D. Roe died suddenly from a heart attack at their home on December\n11, 1929, less than a month before his seventy-\ufb01rst birthday. In 1931 Josephine Roe\nhad her dissertation printed in two parts, the second of which reproduced tables\nwhose plates had been prepared by a student; the printed versions were referenced\nin mathematical and statistical literature at least through 1961.\n\nIn response to an inquiry from Helen Owens, Roe wrote on her questionnaire\nin 1940 that she was a Methodist and a Republican. She listed her honors as Phi\nBeta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, and Sigma Xi, and indicated that she was a fellow of\nAAAS. She noted that she was a life member of the AMS and also of the Ameri-\ncan Astronomical Society. She wrote that she \u201cassisted [her] husband somewhat in\nhis private Observatory in [their] residence.

      "text": "BAREIS, Grace M. December 19, 1875\u2013June 15, 1962.\nHeidelberg University (BA 1897), Ohio State University (PhD 1909).\n\nGrace Marie Bareis was born in Canal Winchester, Ohio, the \ufb01rst of two daugh-\nters of Amanda Jane (Schoch) (1850\u20131908) and George Frederick Bareis (1852\u2013\n1932). Both parents were natives of Ohio. Her father was educated in district and\npublic schools in Ohio and conducted a successful lumber business in Canal Winch-\nester. He was a student of history and archaeology and published a history of the\nlocal township in 1902. Grace Bareis\u2019s younger sister was Helen Paul (1877\u20131934).\nAfter attending the public schools in Canal Winchester, Grace Bareis studied\nat Heidelberg University (Heidelberg College after 1926) in Ti\ufb03n, Ohio. She took\nthe classical course and participated in the Hesperian Literary Society and the\nOratorical Association before graduating in 1897 as valedictorian of her class. Her\nsister graduated from Heidelberg two years later.\n\nGrace Bareis spent the two years 1897\u201399 as a graduate student at Bryn Mawr\nCollege, where she contributed a paper to the Mathematical Journal Club in spring\n1899. She also graduated from the Columbus Normal School in Ohio in 1899. Bareis\nwas a teacher at Miss Roney\u2019s School in Bala, Pennsylvania, from 1899 until 1906\nwhile continuing her graduate work in mathematics at nearby Bryn Mawr College\nduring 1902\u201306. During her last two years in Pennsylvania, she submitted at least\nfourteen solutions to problems in the Monthly, seven of which were chosen to appear.\nIn 1906 Bareis returned to the Midwest to \ufb01nish her graduate work in math-\nematics at Ohio State University. She was a fellow there 1906\u201308, was appointed\nassistant professor in 1908, and was the \ufb01rst recipient of a doctorate in mathematics\nfrom Ohio State when she received her PhD in 1909. After nearly forty years on\nthe faculty she retired as assistant professor emeritus in 1946. During her years at\nOhio State, she directed master\u2019s theses, mainly in geometry, for at least \ufb01fteen\ngraduate students, of whom at least eight were women. Other positions she noted\nover the years include faculty member in the Education College, advisor for Arts\nCollege women, and group leader for freshman week. She participated in the OSU\nfaculty club and the faculty women\u2019s club as well as the Columbus College Club.\nShe spent the summer of 1920 at Columbia University, and in 1922 her 1909 PhD\ndissertation was printed. During World War II, she taught students in the Army\nSpecialized Training Program at Ohio State, and for two years after her retirement\nshe continued to teach because of the postwar shortage of instructors.\n\nIn 1948 Bareis gave a gift of $2000 to Ohio State University to help commemorate\nits seventy-\ufb01fth anniversary. She asked that the interest on her donation be used to\nfund the Grace M. Bareis Mathematical Prize to be awarded annually after a written\ncontest. She believed that sophomores would bene\ufb01t most from participation in such\na contest.\n\nDuring her lifetime Bareis remained active in her college alumni organizations;\nshe belonged to the Ohio State alumni association, was on the Ohio State University\nalumni council, and from 1935 to 1956 was a member of the board of trustees of\nHeidelberg College. She was the second woman to hold that position: her father had\nbeen president of the board for many years before his death in 1932, and her sister,\nHelen Bareis, completed his term after his death. Heidelberg gave Grace Bareis an\nhonorary degree of Doctor of Pedagogy at the hundredth anniversary of the college\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBAREIS - 2\n\nin 1950, and the Bareis Hall of Science was built there in 1964 to honor her and\nher father. Grace Bareis had made a sizable gift towards its construction.\n\nAlthough Bareis never served as an o\ufb03cer of the MAA or its Ohio Section, she\nattended many national meetings and attended more than thirty annual meetings of\nthe section from its inception in 1916 through 1955, nine years after her retirement.\nBareis was active in church activities: she was a member of the Evangelical\nand Reformed Church at Canal Winchester, belonged to the Missionary Society,\nparticipated in the Business Women\u2019s Sunday School class, and was an a\ufb03liate\nmember of the Indianola Methodist Church. She volunteered with the Red Cross\nand belonged to the DAR, the Ohioana Library Association, and the Franklin\nCounty Historical Society; she was a life member of the Ohio State Archeological\nand Historical Society. She maintained her home, and spent the summers, in Canal\nWinchester. At one point she described her hobbies as gardening and farming;\nshe managed a farm near Brice, Ohio. In response to a question for her entry in\nWoman\u2019s Who\u2019s Who of America of 1914\u201315, Bareis indicated that she favored\nwoman su\ufb00rage.\n\nGrace Bareis lived for twenty-six years with a friend, her former student and\nlater mathematics department colleague, Margaret Eloise Jones (1895\u20131979), in\nColumbus.

October 16, 1893\u2013January 13, 1936.\nTransylvania University (BA 1914), University of Missouri (MA 1921), Cor-\nnell University (PhD 1924).\n\nJulia May Dale was born in Shelbyville, Kentucky, the second of six children\nof Ida May (Todd) (b. 1867) and James Harrison Dale (1861\u20131937). Her parents\nwere both natives of Kentucky and married in 1888. Her siblings were James Todd\n(1891\u20131953), Martha King (b. 1896), Lilly B. (1897\u20131989), Mary Ida (b. 1903), and\nWilliam Pratt (1909\u20131971). Her father was a farmer and moved with the family\nto Alabama in 1916. Julia Dale\u2019s nephew, William Hardin True, noted that both\nparents were graduates of Eminence College, a small coeducational college in Ken-\ntucky that closed in 1895. He also wrote that James H. Dale served as Kentucky\u2019s\nsecretary of agriculture and later became a prominent breeder of shorthorn cattle\nin Alabama.\n\nJulia Dale graduated from Shelbyville High School in 1910. She then attended\nTransylvania University in Lexington, Kentucky, where she was a class secretary\nand was an o\ufb03cer in the local YWCA and the literary club. She was in charge of\ncostumes for the girls\u2019 glee club and was a member of Chi Omega, a social sorority.\nThe senior class prophecy foresees \u201cJulia Dale, as irrepressible as ever, though she\nwas \u2018Math Professor\u2019 at Yale\u201d (The Crimson Yearbook 1914, Transylvania Univer-\nsity Special Collections).\n\nAfter graduating cum laude from Transylvania in 1914, Dale taught for a year in\nthe high school in Aberdeen, Mississippi. In 1916\u201318 she taught at William Woods\nCollege, then a junior college for women, in Fulton, Missouri. The dean of the\ngraduate school at the University of Missouri, Walter Miller, wrote Cornell\u2019s Dean\nCreighton on February 18, 1922, that he had \u201cdiscovered her [at William Woods]\nand brought her to the University of Missouri on a graduate scholarship\u201d (Julia\nDale Folder, Box 61, Graduate School Records, Rare and Manuscript Collections,\nCornell University Library). After a year on scholarship, Dale spent the following\nthree years, 1919\u201322, as an instructor in mathematics at the University of Missouri\nwhile receiving her master\u2019s degree in 1921.\n\nDale was admitted to the graduate school at Cornell University as a candidate\nfor the PhD in September 1922. She was a graduate scholar in mathematics 1922\u2013\n23 and an Erastus Brooks fellow in mathematics 1923\u201324. The address she used\nfor the December 1924 membership list of the AMS was the Cornell chapter of Chi\nOmega, her sorority as an undergraduate at Transylvania University.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD in 1924, having written a dissertation in analysis and\nwith minors in geometry and physics, Dale was an instructor for a year at the Uni-\nversity of Oklahoma. While there she also volunteered at nearby Native American\nreservations. From 1925 until 1930, Dale was head of the mathematics department\nat Delta State Teachers College (now Delta State University) in Cleveland, Mis-\nsissippi. She was active in the MAA and was secretary-treasurer of the Louisiana-\nMississippi Section in 1929. She was an avid bridge player, did needlepoint, was\ninterested in athletics, and helped coach the women\u2019s basketball team at Delta\nState.\n\nIn 1930 Dale moved to Duke University, where she was an assistant professor\nand head of the women\u2019s division of mathematics at Duke University. \u201cIt is said\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nDALE - 2\n\nthat her chief motive in reluctantly leaving Delta State was to accompany her\nbrother, Billy, then convalescent from a serious illness, who had prepared at [Delta\nState] to enter upon graduate study at Duke\u201d (\u201cRecording the Life of Delta State\nTeachers College\u201d). Her brother made his home with her and subsequently received\nhis doctorate in history from Duke in 1941. While at Duke, Dale taught a variety\nof classes including some in the graduate school. For example, the announcements\nfor 1934\u201335 indicate that she was scheduled to teach courses in Fourier\u2019s Series and\nSpherical Harmonics, In\ufb01nite Series, and Algebraic Geometry.\n\nJulia Dale died in 1936 at age forty-two in the Duke University hospital of renal\nfailure after su\ufb00ering from chronic kidney disease for some time. It was reported in\na letter of September 7, 1976, from W. M. Causey of the University of Mississippi\nto Professor Miller at Transylvania that she was to have been married to Dr. W.\nW. Elliot, a professor of mathematics at Duke University. (Transylvania University\nSpecial Collections) Elliot had been a fellow graduate student and Hurwitz advisee\nat Cornell. Dale was survived by her parents, two brothers, and three sisters. Her\nremains are interred in Greensboro, Alabama.\n\nIn the spring of 1938 friends and relatives established the Julia Dale Memorial\nFund at Duke; the income from this fund supports the Julia Dale Prize awarded\nannually by the Department of Mathematics to a mathematics major (or majors)\non the basis of excellence in mathematics.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liation: MAA.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1921 Comparison of approximation methods.

May 27, 1902\u2013August 29, 1989.\nRealgymnasium der Schillerschule (Frankfurt am Main) (ABITUR 1922), Uni-\nversit\u00a8at Z\u00a8urich (PhD 1927).\n\nLulu Hofmann was the middle daughter of Clara (Olshauson) (1875\u20131938) and\nOtto Hofmann (1863\u20131956). Her parents were born in Germany, her mother in\nMertsch\u00a8utz and her father in Frankfurt-am-Main. Her mother was the daughter\nof a theologian; she attended a Lyzeum, a secondary school for girls, and became\na homemaker after her marriage in 1897. Her father attended a Gymnasium, the\nclassical German secondary school, and was a stockbroker. Lulu Hofman and her\nolder sister, Emy (1900\u20131994), were both born in New York City. Her younger\nsister, Ilse, was born in 1910 in Frankfort, Germany. Both sisters attended the same\nGymnasium in Frankfort as Lulu; her older sister also attended an academy of art\nin Karlsruhe, and her younger sister studied at universities in Brussels and in Paris;\nthey later married and became homemakers. Her older sister was also a painter,\nand her younger sister was a certi\ufb01ed translator. Her parents were supportive of\ntheir daughters\u2019 higher education.\n\nHofmann was raised bilingually in German and English and received her com-\nplete education in Germany and Switzerland. She attended the Realgymnasium der\nSchillerschule in Frankfurt and passed her Abitur, allowing her to attend university,\nin 1922. She then attended the Universit\u00a8at Freiburg 1922\u201323 and the Universit\u00a8at\nZ\u00a8urich 1923\u201326. During 1924\u201326 she also studied part time at the Eidgen\u00a8ossiche\nTechnische Hochschule (ETH) in Zurich, where Hermann Weyl held the chair in\nmathematics until 1930, when he took the chair at G\u00a8ottingen that was vacated\nwhen Hilbert retired. Starting in 1926, Hofmann assisted Weyl in translating Ger-\nman manuscripts into English. Hofmann received her doctorate from the Universit\u00a8at\nZ\u00a8urich in 1927 with a dissertation directed by E. G. Togliatti, who was on the fac-\nulty 1924\u201326. While there she also studied philosophy under Edmund Husserl and\nMartin Heidegger. A niece later indicated that Hofmann had described Weyl as\nsomeone with whom she had worked closely, both as a student and afterwards.\n\nLulu Hofmann returned to the United States in January 1927 and gave an ad-\ndress of Spring\ufb01eld, Ohio, when she applied for membership in the AMS that spring.\nShe was at Columbia University as an assistant in mathematics 1927\u201328 and as a\nlecturer 1928\u201329; she was an instructor at Barnard College 1929\u201337. She worked\nclosely with Edward Kasner of Columbia in that period, assisting him with a paper\nthat appeared in the Transactions of the AMS in 1928, and doing joint work with\nhim. Hofmann also continued to assist Weyl, and in a published version of lectures\nhe delivered at Yale University in 1931 he wrote: \u201cI do not want to omit acknowl-\nedging my indebtedness to my friend, Dr. Lulu Hofmann of Columbia University,\n. . . for the devoted assistance which she has rendered me in the translation of my\nmanuscripts into English on this as well as on similar previous occasions\u201d (The\nOpen World, v). In 1933 Weyl came from G\u00a8ottingen to the Institute for Advanced\nStudy, and Hofmann continued to help him with English. She later translated his\nbook Symmetry into German.\n\nIn November 1936 Lulu Hofmann married Baron Wilhelm Alfred von Bechtol-\nsheim (1881\u20131968). He was born in Upper Bavaria, the son of the Chamberlain\nfor the Grand Duke of Luxemburg and later for the King of Bavaria. Baron von\nBechtolsheim had been a Commander in the Imperial German Navy until 1921 and\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBECHTOLSHEIM - 2\n\nimmigrated to the United States in 1926. He later was a pharmaceutical salesman.\nThey had no children, although he had children by a previous marriage.\n\nDuring the summer session of 1937 Lulu von Bechtolsheim was an instructor\nat Hunter College. She wrote in 1937 that she was then writing a textbook on\nanalytic geometry that was di\ufb00erent from current texts, and that the material\nhad been used in her classes during the last three terms. That fall she became an\ninstructor at Queens College where she remained until 1940. She made a trip to\nEurope in summer 1938. By 1944 she and her husband had moved to California,\nwhere, during the winter quarter of 1943\u201344, she was a lecturer in mathematics at\nStanford University. Lulu Bechtolsheim, as she was then known, spent the largest\npart of her career at the University of Redlands, east of Los Angeles. She was\nassistant professor 1944\u201350, associate professor 1950\u201356, and professor 1956\u201361,\nbefore her retirement in 1961. In addition to her role as a mathematics professor,\nshe also taught astronomy, Italian, French, and German at Redlands and knew\nsome Spanish, Portuguese, and Greek. She served, as well, on the honors committee\nand committee on comprehensive examinations. She also was an acting assistant\nprofessor of mathematics at Stanford in summer 1947 and attended an institute for\ncollege mathematics teachers at Stanford in summer 1955.\n\nAfter her retirement, Bechtolsheim continued her scholarly activity, mainly by\nengaging in a variety of translations of mathematical manuscripts: by Leopold Nach-\nbin from Portuguese into English, by George P\u00b4olya from English into German, and\nby Bruno de Finetti from Italian into German. The translations into German ap-\npeared in the Wissenschaft und Kultur series published by Birkh\u00a8auser Verlag.\n\nBechtolsheim was interested in poetry. From 1972 she was a member of the An-\nthroposophical Society, an organization promoting the spiritual philosophy based\non the works of Rudolf Steiner, and from 1981 she belonged to the Christian Com-\nmunity, inspired by his work as well.\n\nLulu Bechtolsheim died following an intestinal blockage in 1989 at age eighty-\nseven in Redlands, California. She was survived by two step-sons in West Germany\nand a sister. Services were held at the Christian Community Church in North\nHollywood, and interment was at Hillside Memorial Park.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, AAUP, Sigma Xi.\n\nDissertation:\n1927 [Hofmann, L.] \u00a8Uber einige spezielle Strahlenkongruenzen, die mit analytischen Funk-\ntionen zusammenh\u00a8angen.

Stark (1850\u20131926) of Connecticut.\nIt was reported in the 1900 census that she, her parents, and her paternal grand-\nmother were living in Norwich. At that time, her parents had been married sixteen\nyears, and another child had died. In 1900 and 1910 her father was a salesman, and\nin 1920 a buyer, for a dry goods store.\n\nStark received her elementary education at the Pearl Street School and the Mt.\nPleasant Street School, both in Norwich; her secondary education was at the Nor-\nwich Free Academy.\n\nAfter graduating from Brown (Women\u2019s College) in 1916, Stark remained the\nnext year as a Lyra Brown Nickerson fellow and received her master\u2019s degree in 1917.\nFrom 1917 until 1919 Stark was the professor of mathematics, and sole mathematics\ninstructor, at Meredith College, a women\u2019s college in Raleigh, North Carolina. When\nshe left, her professorship at Meredith was taken for one year by Ida Barney.\n\nStark then became an instructor at Wellesley College where she was to remain,\nexcept for further graduate work, for the rest of her career. During her \ufb01rst year\nthere, 1919\u201320, she took courses from Helen A. Merrill and Mabel M. Young while\nteaching part time. As early as 1921 she was interested in geometrical constructions,\ngiving the \ufb01rst of many talks to mathematics clubs on that topic. She studied at the\nUniversity of Chicago during the summer quarter of 1923 and autumn 1924 through\nsummer 1925. She held a fellowship during 1924\u201325 and received her doctorate in\n1926 with a dissertation in the calculus of variations.\n\nIn 1927, a year after receiving her PhD, Stark was promoted to assistant professor\nat Wellesley. She was promoted to associate professor in 1936 and professor in 1945.\nShe retired as a Lewis Atterbury Stimson professor emeritus of mathematics in 1960.\nIn 1932 Stark attended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich.\nShe continued to study mathematics: at the University of Chicago during the fall\nquarter of 1938 and at Harvard 1939\u201340. Between 1940 and 1950 she published ten\nbook reviews in the National Mathematics Magazine (renamed Mathematics Mag-\nazine in 1947). During this period, and continuing through 1960, Stark was on the\neditorial sta\ufb00 of this journal; starting in 1944 she served as the editor of the \u201cBrief\nNotes and Comments,\u201d and when the journal changed its name she became editor\nof the \u201cMathematical Miscellany\u201d section for an additional three years. Through-\nout her career she was involved with mathematics clubs. She wrote a mathematical\nplay, \u201cModern Mathematics Looks Up Its Ancestors,\u201d which was performed by the\nWellesley mathematics club in 1931 and again just before its publication in 1936. It\nwas also performed after its publication by, at least, Kappa Mu Epsilon at Mount\nSt. Scholastica College. Stark participated in mathematics institutes for high school\nand college teachers from 1955 to 1958 at Middlebury College, Williams College,\nDartmouth College, and Brandeis University, respectively; during 1957 she was a\ndiscussion leader for descriptive geometry. She continued to write reviews in the\n1950s and early 1960s, \ufb01rst for Scripta Mathematica and then for the American\nMathematical Monthly. She served on the council of the Association of Teachers of\nMathematics in New England.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSTARK - 2\n\nIn at least the early 1930s, Marion Stark\u2019s widowed mother lived with her in\nWellesley. Later Stark shared her home with Grace Ethel Arthur, the secretary to\npresidents of Wellesley for nearly four decades, who retired in 1952. During World\nWar II, Stark temporarily adopted several children from Europe and a child from\nKorea, at least some through the Foster Parents Plan and the Christian Children\u2019s\nFund.\n\nStark was an enthusiastic traveler whose summer trips included, among many\nothers, Europe in 1921, Nova Scotia in 1955, and Glacier National Park in 1956. In\nthe late 1930s she described herself as a Baptist and a Republican and indicated\nthat her hobbies were poetry and horticulture and that her favorite recreation was\ntennis.\n\nAfter her retirement in 1960, Stark lived in Rockport, Massachusetts, where she\nwas a member of the Congregational church. In 1974 she moved to New Jersey. In\naddition to being an avid gardener, she wrote poetry, collected nautical art, and in\nher later years taped recordings of mathematical books for blind students.\n\nStark su\ufb00ered a stroke in about 1971. She died at age eighty-seven at her home\nin Waterford, New Jersey, in 1982. It was noted in the Boston Globe obituary that\nshe had no survivors except for the children she befriended. Funeral services and\nburial were in Norwich, Connecticut.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Canadian Math. Congress (now Canadian\nMath.

April 3, 1883\u2013January 7, 1977.\nSmith College (BA 1905, MA 1913), University of Michigan (PhD 1920).\n\nSusan Miller Rambo was born in Easton, Pennsylvania, the eldest of \ufb01ve children\nof Annie Roberta (Kortz) (b. 1852) and George Green Rambo (b. 1842). Her mother\nwas from Easton, in eastern Pennsylvania. Her father, who was born in New Jersey,\nwas a wholesale grocer in Easton after his marriage to Annie Kortz in about 1880.\nThe other children were Ella K. (b. 1884), George D. (1886\u20131945), Isabel K. (1887\u2013\n1974)), and Annie R. (b. 1890).\n\nSusan Rambo attended high school in her home town of Easton before entering\nSmith College in Northampton, Massachusetts. She graduated from Smith in 1905\nand taught mathematics in the high school in Hoosick Falls, New York, near the\nMassachusetts border for two of the years between 1905 and 1908.\n\nIn the fall of 1908, Susan Rambo and Pauline Sperry, who had earned a BA\nin 1906 and an MA in 1908 from Smith, were hired as assistants in mathematics\nat Smith College, in part, presumably, since Ruth G. Wood was on leave to study\nat G\u00a8ottingen for the year. Except for leaves of absence, Rambo remained in the\ndepartment at Smith the remainder of her career: as assistant 1908\u201311, instructor\n1911\u201318, assistant professor 1918\u201322, associate professor 1922\u201337, professor 1937\u2013\n48, and professor emeritus after her retirement in 1948.\n\nIn addition to her teaching, Rambo also took graduate courses in her early years\nat Smith. She had courses in mathematics (Projective Geometry, Theory of Func-\ntions, Descriptive Geometry, and History of Mathematics) and in astronomy (Ana-\nlytical Mechanics, Transit Instrument, Equatorial Telescope, Computing, and His-\ntory of Astronomy) and received a master\u2019s degree from Smith in 1913. References\nin her master\u2019s thesis also include lectures by C. J. Keyser at Columbia University\nin 1907 and by G. A. Bliss at the University of Chicago in 1910.\n\nIn 1916, having taken a leave of absence for the year 1916\u201317, Rambo entered\nthe University of Michigan. Her Smith colleague and friend, Suzan Benedict, had\nreceived her PhD two years earlier from Michigan. Rambo was in residence at\nMichigan for two years and received her degree in 1920, two years after returning\nto her position at Smith.\n\nRambo\u2019s many contributions at Smith include introducing a statistics course in\nher \ufb01rst decade there and serving as department chairman from 1934 to 1940. She\nattended the International Congress of Mathematicians in Bologna in 1928. Rambo\nwas also a member of the Connecticut Valley Section of the Association of Teachers\nof Mathematics in New England and of the Round Hill Club, a paper reading club\nin Spring\ufb01eld. She took a leave of absence the second semester 1937\u201338 during\nwhich she made a trip around the world.\n\nIn the Smith College Twenty-Fifth Reunion Class Book in 1930 it was noted\nthat Susan Rambo \u201cdrives a Ford, gardens, and keeps a charming home with a\nfriend.\u201d She shared a house with Suzan Benedict at one site from 1918 to 1924 and\nat a second from 1924 until Benedict\u2019s death in 1942. Their home was typically the\nlocation for the department Christmas party. In 1945 Rambo relinquished her life\ntenure on the house, and it went to Smith to be sold and the proceeds to be used\nfor scholarships.\n\nRambo died in a Northampton nursing home in 1977 and was survived by a\nniece and three nephews; at least two other nephews had been killed in World War\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nRAMBO - 2\n\nII.

      "text": "WHITE, Marion Ballantyne. March 28, 1871\u2013January 30, 1958.\nUniversity of Michigan (PhB 1893), University of Wisconsin (MA 1906), Uni-\nversity of Chicago (PhD 1910).\n\nMarion Ballantyne White was the third of \ufb01ve children of Jennie E. (McLaren) and\nSamuel Holmes White. Her mother was born in Glasgow, Scotland, in 1840 and was\na teacher living in Chicago before her marriage in 1865. Marion White\u2019s father, also a\nteacher, was born in New York in 1830 and was a widower at the time of his marriage\nto Jennie McLaren. He held a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Michigan and a\nlaw degree from the Albany Law School. After \ufb01nishing his education he was a principal\nof public schools in Chicago and then of the Peoria Normal School. He served in many\nimportant educational positions in Illinois and nationally. He edited the Illinois Teacher for\neight years and was president of the Illinois State Teachers\u2019 Association; he was secretary\nof the National Education Association in 1866, 1872, and 1873, and was president in 1874.\nHe died in 1882. Her siblings were older brothers, Samuel Dexter (ca. 1865\u20131941) and\nJames McLaren (1867\u20131933); younger brother, Alfred Holmes (1873\u20131953), and sister,\nJennie P. (b. 1876). Marion White was born in Peoria, Illinois, and did her precollege\nwork in the public schools there.\n\nWhite was a student at Smith College 1888\u201389 but left after one year and taught in one\nof the Peoria public schools 1889\u201390. She enrolled in the University of Michigan in October\n1890 and graduated three years later, the same year as her younger brother, Alfred. The\ntwo years after her graduation, Marion White taught mathematics in the high school in\nPueblo, Colorado. During 1895\u201399 and 1900\u201301 she taught mathematics in the Peoria\nhigh school. In the intervening year, 1899\u20131900, she traveled abroad with her mother and\nsister; the travels included Munich, where she studied in the winter.\n\nMarion B. White was instructor of mathematics at the University of Illinois from 1901\nto 1908. While she was at Illinois, the mathematics club was organized in 1902\u201303, and\nthe \ufb01rst PhD was granted in 1903. White earned her master\u2019s degree at the University of\nWisconsin in 1906 by studying there during three summers. After leaving Illinois she did\nher doctoral work at the University of Chicago from 1908 to 1910 and was a fellow her last\nyear there. While in Chicago, White was living with her widowed mother and her younger\nsister, who was a high school teacher. Her dissertation was the third directed by G. A.\nBliss, and White was the \ufb01rst student of Bliss who had not begun the dissertation under\nthe direction of Heinrich Maschke or Oskar Bolza. White\u2019s dissertation in the calculus of\nvariations appeared in the 1912 Transactions of the AMS; in a 1929 paper in the Bulletin\nof the AMS, Marston Morse mentioned her paper, noting that he did not use her results\nbut thought them interesting.\n\nIn 1910 White joined the faculty at the University of Kansas as assistant professor.\nWhile there, she helped with a teacher placement bureau to assist graduates obtain teach-\ning positions in secondary schools. In 1913\u201314, she was one of three faculty members to\ngive a paper on integral equations to the department. In his history of the mathemat-\nics department at the University of Kansas, G. Baley Price includes a letter of March 18,\n1914, to the dean from the the department chairman who wrote, \u201cThe department believes\nthat Professor Marion B. White is entitled to promotion to an associate professorship on\naccount of her e\ufb00ective work in the department and in addition on account of her work\nand in\ufb02uence among the young women of the university, as well as her untiring energy\nin other lines of university activity\u201d (607). Price also quotes Wilimina Everett Pitcher\nwho recalls the university in the period 1903\u201311: \u201cMarian [sic] White may have been an\nexperiment. K.U. boys were not used to women in the math department. She was there\nbecause [John Wesley] Young brought her. . . . She was a very likable person\u201d (674\u201375).\nYoung left Kansas in 1911, only one year after White came and three years before she left.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWHITE - 2\n\nIn 1914 Marion White moved to Michigan State Normal College (now Eastern Michigan\nUniversity) in Ypsilanti, where she had been appointed associate professor of mathematics\nand dean of women. She served as dean for two years and associate professor four years.\nIn 1918 she joined the faculty at Carleton College in Minnesota and remained there until\nher retirement at age sixty-six in 1937 because of the ill health of a relative. She was\nassistant professor 1918\u201330, dean of women 1922\u201324, and associate professor 1930\u201337.\nThe Carleton alumni magazine notice of her death records that \u201cshe was an especially\nsuccessful classroom teacher \u2013 known . . . for the personal stimulus and encouragement\nshe gave the students who passed through her classes. . . .

      "text": "GRAY, Alta (Odoms). October 1, 1910\u2013December 30, 2001.\nUniversity of Cincinnati (BA 1931, MA 1932, PhD 1936).\n\nAlta Harriet Odoms was born in Fredonia, Indiana, the third of four children\nof Ethel (Nelson) (ca. 1878\u20131962) and John Bert Odoms (b. ca. 1872). Both her\nparents were natives of Ohio. She had two older sisters, Berta (b. ca. 1904) and\nLulu (1909\u20132005), and a younger brother, Howard (1918\u20131995). In 1910 her father\nwas a farmer in Crawford County, Ohio; in the 1920s and 1930s he was a plasterer,\nand the family was living in Clermont county, east of Cincinnati, Ohio.\n\nAfter Alta Odoms graduated from high school in Milford, Ohio, all of her college\neducation was completed at the nearby University of Cincinnati. As an undergrad-\nuate she was a member of the University of Cincinnati mathematics club before\nreceiving her BA in 1931; she served as treasurer while a graduate student in fall\n1932. Immediately after her graduation, Odoms continued her graduate work at the\nUniversity of Cincinnati and received her master\u2019s degree in 1932 and her PhD in\n1936. Essential parts of her dissertation appeared in an article that she coauthored\nwith H. L. Miller. Miller, a 1931 student of Odom\u2019s advisor C. N. Moore, was then\non the faculty of the College of Engineering and Commerce at Cincinnati.\n\nFrom 1935 through March 1937, Odoms was in New York working as an editorial\nassistant for the American Mathematical Society after Caroline Seely\u2019s resignation\nas clerk; she was succeeded by Mildred M. Sullivan. While in New York, she regu-\nlarly attended meetings of the AMS there. She also auditioned for and was selected\nto sing with the New York City Oratorio Society. She resigned from the AMS job\nafter two years and looked for a teaching position. She wrote to one of the authors\nin 1992 that Duke o\ufb00ered her part-time teaching in the Woman\u2019s College if she\nwould work for the Duke Mathematical Journal, which had begun two years earlier\nin 1935. Apparently the teaching part of the job just lasted for a year, after which\nshe worked as secretary for the journal.\n\nOn December 10, 1938, Alta Odoms married William Frederick Gray. Gray, born\nin Charleston, South Carolina, in about 1913, and Odoms met in Durham, North\nCarolina. Interested in a career in government and foreign service, William Gray\nentered the Fletcher School, the oldest exclusively graduate school of international\na\ufb00airs in the United States, in Medford, Massachusetts, in 1941. This move caused\nAlta Gray to resign from her position at the Duke Mathematical Journal, but she\nfound work in 1941\u201342 as secretary of the radiation laboratory at MIT. She de-\nscribed herself as \u201cuseful as jack-of-all-trades\u201d in the 1992 letter. The Grays had a\nson and two daughters.\n\nThe Grays went to Washington, D.C., in 1942, where William Gray worked for\nthe Board of Economic Warfare. Alta Gray \u201cspent the next ten years producing and\nenjoying three children,\u201d according to her 1992 letter. In 1952 William Gray joined\nthe State Department Foreign Service and served in countries in Europe and Latin\nAmerica. Between assignments and after Gray\u2019s retirement in 1964, they lived in\nthe Washington, D.C., area.\n\nAlta Gray was interested in politics, history, and nineteenth-century literature.\nShe wrote in 1992, \u201cI have had a wonderful life. . . . Forgive me for having packed\naway all those mathematics books long years ago.\u201d\n\nWilliam Gray died in Charlottesville, Virginia, in 1986. Alta Gray continued to\nlive in Charlottesville and was a long-time resident there of Branchlands Retirement\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGRAY, A. O. - 2\n\nVillage.

      "text": "WELLS, Mary Evelyn. August 20, 1881\u2013October 7, 1965.\nMount Holyoke College (BA 1904), University of Chicago (MS 1907, PhD\n1915).\n\nMary Evelyn Wells was born in LeRaysville, Pennsylvania, the second of three children\nof Delphine (Whitford) (b. 1854) and William Henry Wells (b. 1851). Her older brother,\nGeorge E., was born in May 1879; her younger sister, Anna M., was born in May 1885. Her\nparents and siblings were born in Pennsylvania, where her father was listed as a farmer in\nthe 1880 census. In 1900 her parents had been married twenty-\ufb01ve years, and the family\nwas living in Naugatuck, Connecticut, where her father was a carpenter. In 1910 her\nmother was widowed, living with her other daughter and son-in-law in Naugatuck, and\nworking at home as a dressmaker.\n\nMary Wells received most of her elementary education at home and in the public schools\nof Brushville and LeRaysville, Pennsylvania. She attended a little over a year of grammar\nschool and four years of high school in Naugatuck and graduated from the academic course\nin the Naugatuck high school in 1900. That fall she entered Mount Holyoke College, from\nwhich she graduated four years later as a mathematics major. She stayed at Mount Holyoke\nas a department tutor in mathematics for a year after her graduation. She was later elected\na Mount Holyoke alumna member of Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nIn the fall of 1905, Wells entered the University of Chicago, where she studied for three\nquarters in each of the years 1905\u201306 and 1906\u201307. She was a fellow the second year\nand received her master\u2019s degree in 1907. She became an instructor at Mount Holyoke\nCollege that fall and taught there for \ufb01ve years before returning to the University of\nChicago as a graduate student in 1912. She stayed at Chicago two years, with a fellowship\nfrom Mount Holyoke 1912\u201313 and a fellowship from Chicago 1913\u201314 during which she\ntaught one quarter. While at Chicago for her master\u2019s and doctoral degrees, she studied\nunder E. H. Moore, H. Maschke, L. E. Dickson, H. E. Slaught, A. C. Lunn, and E. J.\nWilczynski in mathematics and under F. R. Moulton and W. D. MacMillan in astronomy.\nHer dissertation was supervised by E. H. Moore, and the PhD degree was awarded in 1915.\nWells had also served as a reader in mathematics for the College Entrance Examination\nBoard in New York City from 1908 to 1913.\n\nDuring 1914\u201315 Mary Evelyn Wells was an acting associate professor at Oberlin College,\nas a temporary replacement for Mary Sinclair, who was away for her \ufb01rst sabbatical. In\nthe fall of 1915, Wells joined the faculty at Vassar College, where she remained except for\nleaves until her retirement in 1948. She was instructor 1915\u201320, assistant professor 1920\u2013\n22, associate professor 1922\u201328, professor 1928\u201348, and emeritus professor after 1948. From\n1936 to 1948 she was chairman of the department. According to Benjamin Lotto at Vassar,\nher teaching included a secret course in cryptography for the navy during World War II;\nthe course was taught from about 1943 until the end of the war and had been requested\nby the navy in order to train women with mathematical and language skills.\n\nWells traveled abroad in the summers of 1922 and 1924, with records showing her\nreturning to New York by ship from Southampton and Hamburg, respectively. She then\nhad a leave of absence from Vassar from 1926 to 1928. During the \ufb01rst year, 1926\u201327,\nshe was an exchange professor and head of the department at Women\u2019s Christian College,\nUniversity of Madras, India. The next year, 1927\u201328, she studied at the Istituto Fisico of\nthe University of Rome, where Vito Volterra was professor. She had corresponded with\nhim in 1925, before she left for India, and in 1928 she published a translation into English\nof Volterra\u2019s 1926 paper that describes his famous theory on population growth. This\npaper appeared in a journal published in Denmark by the Conseil international pour\nl\u2019exploration de la mer. Four letters Wells wrote to Volterra are in the archives of the\nAccademia Nazionale dei Lincei.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWELLS - 2\n\nAccording to her faculty \ufb01le at Vassar, Wells translated other works, most notably\nBernhard Riemann\u2019s \u201cOn the hypotheses which lie at the foundations of geometry,\u201d which\nappeared in A Source Book in Mathematics by David Eugene Smith (New York: McGraw-\nHill, 1929; reissued New York: Dover Publications, 1959). That translation is credited to\nH. S. White, and a note in her faculty \ufb01le indicates that \u201cMiss Wells said her name was\nomitted by mistake.\u201d\n\nDuring 1936\u201337, Wells had a leave of absence from Vassar and returned to Women\u2019s\nChristian College, University of Madras. She served as a trustee of the University of Madras\nfrom 1930 to 1937 and again after 1948. She was also a director of St. Christopher\u2019s College\nin Madras 1928\u201337, of Women\u2019s Christian College in Madras 1927\u201337 and after 1948, and\nof Women\u2019s Christian College in Tokyo 1930\u201337. In May 1940 she wrote to Helen Owens\nthat she had \u201cpublished in India and Denmark\u201d (Owens Papers). The latter publication\npresumably refers to her 1928 translation of Volterra, but her Indian publication remains\na mystery.\n\nWells joined the AMS in 1908, about a year after she received her master\u2019s degree, and\nfrom that time until 1942, except when abroad, she normally attended several meetings a\nyear of the society. In about 1940 she described herself as an Episcopalian whose favorite\nrecreations were skating and climbing. Other favorite leisure activities were reading, walk-\ning, and gardening. Under religious activities, she mentioned that she was on a community\nchurch board for several years.\n\nFor many years Wells maintained a home in Southport, Maine, where she spent some\nsummers. In 1957 Wells was living in Naugatuck, where her widowed sister, Anna, a for-\nmer teacher, made her home. Wells described her main avocation as work for the Women\u2019s\nChristian College in Madras. In November 1958 she moved from Naugatuck to Wethers-\n\ufb01eld, Connecticut. It appears that she was living in Vermont by about 1959. At various\ntimes she used addresses in Rutland and nearby Pittsford, near her nephew.\n\nMary Evelyn Wells died at age eighty-four in 1965 at a nursing home in Rutland,\nVermont, after a long illness and was cremated in Troy, New York. She was survived by\nher nephew in Pittsford, several grandnephews, and a grandniece. The Mary E. Wells\nand Gertrude Smith Fund, honoring Wells and another long-time mathematics faculty\nmember, was established at Vassar for students demonstrating excellence in mathematics.\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA (charter member), AAAS (fellow), AAUP, Phi\nBeta Kappa, Sigma Xi.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1907 Concerning the motion of a homogeneous rigid bar under the attraction of a non-\nhomogeneous sphere.

      "text": "HAZLETT, Olive C. October 27, 1890\u2013March 8, 1974.\nRadcliffe College (BA 1912), University of Chicago (MS 1913, PhD 1915).\n\nOlive Clio Hazlett was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the only child of Olive Leonora\n(Binkley) (1866\u20131954) and Robert Hazlett (b. 1862), both natives of Ohio. Her\nparents married in November 1888. Around the time of Olive C. Hazlett\u2019s birth\nin 1890, her father was a postal clerk for the Railway Mail Service in Cincinnati.\nIn 1898 her mother graduated from the Laura Memorial Woman\u2019s Medical College\nin Cincinnati (after several mergers, now the University of Cincinnati College of\nMedicine) and was licensed to practice in Ohio and in Massachusetts. The follow-\ning year, Olive Clio Hazlett moved with her mother to the Boston area. In 1900\nher mother was a physician at the Reformatory Prison for Women in Sherborn,\nMassachusetts, while her father, a postal clerk, was enumerated with his family in\nZanesville, Ohio. Robert Hazlett was deceased by March 1905.\n\nOlive C. Hazlett attended public schools in Massachusetts, including Maldin High\nSchool 1904\u201305. She and her mother spent September 1905 through August 1906\ntraveling in France and England, and then she attended Dorchester High School\nin Boston 1906\u201309. After graduating in 1909, she entered Radcli\ufb00e College. At\nRadcli\ufb00e, she specialized in mathematics and had advanced courses with Harvard\nprofessors W. E. Byerly, B. O. Peirce, and W. F. Osgood. She was elected to Phi\nBeta Kappa and graduated magna cum laude in 1912. A letter written January\n18, 1916, indicates that Hazlett spoke of herself as having \u201cdone mathematics ever\nsince she was a child\u201d (M. Carey Thomas to Charlotte A. Scott, Thomas Papers,\nMicro\ufb01lm Edition, Reel 134).\n\nDuring 1912\u201315 Hazlett did graduate work in mathematics and mathematical as-\ntronomy at the University of Chicago. She held a graduate scholarship from Chicago\nthe \ufb01rst year and received her master\u2019s degree in 1913. The next two years she held\na graduate fellowship from Chicago, and during her \ufb01nal year she also held a Boston\nalumnae fellowship awarded by the Boston branch of the Association of Collegiate\nAlumnae (later the American Association of University Women). She received her\nPhD magna cum laude in 1915. The majority of her courses were with E. H. Moore\nand L. E. Dickson in mathematics and with F. R. Moulton in astronomy. Both her\nmaster\u2019s thesis and her doctoral dissertation concerned the characterization of cer-\ntain types of algebras and were directed by Dickson. Hazlett was Dickson\u2019s second\nfemale doctoral student, following by two years Mildred Leonora Sanderson, who\ndied in October 1914 after one semester as an instructor at Wisconsin.\n\nIn 1915\u201316, the year after she received her PhD, Hazlett was an Alice Freeman\nPalmer memorial fellow of Wellesley College for postdoctoral study at Harvard Uni-\nversity. By 1916 she had published three papers about linear associative algebras\nand was later to become the most proli\ufb01c of the women working in pure mathe-\nmatics among those who earned PhD\u2019s in mathematics before 1940. Her later work\nconcerned modular invariants and covariants.\n\nIn February 1916, Hazlett was o\ufb00ered a two-year appointment as an associate\nin mathematics at Bryn Mawr College. Hazlett was not reappointed in 1918, but\nwas hired by Mount Holyoke College in South Hadley, Massachusetts. At the same\ntime, Anna J. Pell (Wheeler) moved from Mount Holyoke to Bryn Mawr as as-\nsociate professor. At Mount Holyoke, Hazlett was assistant professor 1918\u201324 and\nassociate professor 1924\u201325. During most of her time at Mount Holyoke, Hazlett\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHAZLETT - 2\n\nand her mother, who was experiencing some health problems, were living in the\nnearby town of Holyoke, Massachusetts. In addition to her regular classroom teach-\ning responsibilities at Mount Holyoke, Hazlett directed much of the work of the\nmathematics honors students.\n\nHazlett\u2019s years at Mount Holyoke were to be some of her most productive re-\nsearch years, and her accomplishments were acknowledged by the mathematics\ncommunity. In 1920 she was awarded $100 by the American Association for the\nAdvancement of Science \u201cin support of her work in the theory of hypercomplex\nnumbers and invariants\u201d (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 26:467); she also published half\na dozen major research papers while at Mount Holyoke. Her work in invariants and\nmodular analysis was recognized by O. D. Kellogg in his 1921 article, \u201cA decade\nof American mathematics,\u201d in Science. In addition, her long tenure as cooperating\neditor (also called associate editor) of the Transactions of the AMS began with the\nJanuary 1923 issue. In short, she was a major \ufb01gure in algebra in the United States.\nBy late winter in 1925 Hazlett was looking for another position. She indicated in\na letter to E. J. Townsend, the department chair at Illinois, on April 10, 1925, that\nher only reason for considering leaving Mount Holyoke was so she would have better\nresearch opportunities, namely, a better library and contact with other mathemati-\ncians doing research. A letter of March 5, 1925, to Townsend from the American\nCollege Bureau had inquired whether they would consider hiring a woman for the\nfollowing year and had noted that Dickson had written that she is \u201cone of the\ntwo most noted women in America in the \ufb01eld of Mathematics\u201d (Personnel \ufb01le,\nUniversity of Illinois Department of Mathematics records).\n\nHazlett had written to Townsend earlier describing her many academic achieve-\nments. On March 18, 1925, she noted that she had read at least one paper a year\nbefore the AMS since 1915 and attended meetings on the average of twice a year. She\nalso noted her participation in the 1924 International Congress of Mathematicians\nin Toronto, as well as her position on the editorial committee of the Transactions\nof the AMS. She mentioned, too, that she was a member of committee G of AAUP,\nwhich she described as concerned with \u201cincreasing the intellectual interest and rais-\ning the intellectual standards of the undergraduate\u201d (Personnel \ufb01le, University of\nIllinois Department of Mathematics records).\n\nL. E. Dickson wrote to Townsend on her behalf on March 30, 1925. Among his\ncomments are those concerning her mathematics, teaching, and certain aspects of\nher character and personal life.\n\n. . . She has shown more independence in research than any of our\nDoctors for [the] past ten years \u2013 and has published perhaps a\ndozen excellent papers in several branches of algebra showing real\noriginality and the ability to attack successfully quite fundamen-\ntal problems. Her tested ability and her continued eagerness for\nresearch make it certain she will have a very successful career in\nresearch. . . .\n\nMiss H. has been a bit unhappy at times, partly on acct of very\npoor math library at her school, & partly because her taking care\nof her mother has made it hard for her to make ends meet on a\nmodest salary. . . .\n\nDuring the 2 years or more that Miss H. was here, I always\nfound her to be quite a normal person, easy to get on with. . . . The\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHAZLETT - 3\n\ndrawback that she has been at times a bit unhappy (for reasons\ncited) would I am sure be completely remedied by her transfer to\na place like U. Ill., since she is so eager to get to a live place with\na real library. . . .\n\nI am sure she would have the greatest respect & consideration\nfor her colleagues in your dept. Also that she would be most con-\nscientious in her teaching & in carrying out the wishes of the head\nof her dept.\n\nI think it certain you couldn\u2019t \ufb01nd so competent a research per-\nson as she without calling a full professor (& not many of latter are\nher equal.) Her circumstances require a salary of at least $3000 \u2013\n& she is worth much more. . . .\n\nA person of such high math. ability deserves a post in a lead-\ning math. dept. Since she is most kind hearted & considerate, I\nwould fear no di\ufb03culty in her relations to colleagues & students.\n(Personnel \ufb01le, University of Illinois Department of Mathematics\nrecords)\n\nIn 1925 Hazlett took a demotion in rank to join the faculty at the University of\nIllinois, and on January 1, 1926, she was elected to a three-year term as a member\nof the council of the AMS. She was promoted to associate professor in 1929 and\nwas associate professor emeritus after her formal retirement from Illinois in 1959.\nIn 1927 she was \u201cstarred\u201d for mathematics in American Men of Science, one of only\ntwo women \u201cstarred\u201d in that \ufb01eld before 1940 (Charlotte Scott had been \u201cstarred\u201d\nfor mathematics in 1903 and Christine Ladd-Franklin for psychology in 1906).\n\nIn addition to her other teaching, Hazlett taught a graduate course in the theory\nof numbers during the academic year 1927\u201328. In January 1928 she requested a\nleave from the University of Illinois for study in Europe and received a Guggenheim\nfellowship for 1928\u201329 \u201cfor the study of the arithmetics of linear associative algebras\ntogether with their application and interpretation in other lines of mathematics,\nespecially the theory of numbers\u201d (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 34:388). She sailed from\nNew York to Genoa in June 1928 and spent the summer in the Italian Alps with her\nmother. On September 1, 1928, Hazlett arrived in Bologna where she presented a\npaper at the International Congress of Mathematicians. Following a tour of Florence\nand other Italian towns, she arrived in Rome on September 22 and remained there\nfor most of the year except for a few weeks in Zurich. She had hoped to meet with\nEmmy Noether in G\u00a8ottingen to discuss their work, but learned that Noether was in\nMoscow in the winter of 1928\u201329. Realizing that she would not be able to accomplish\neverything she wanted by September 1929, Hazlett applied for and received a one\nyear renewal of her Guggenheim \u201cfor continuation of studies of the arithmetics of\nlinear associative algebras\u201d (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 35:743). She also received a\nsecond leave of absence from Illinois under the condition that she promise to return\nto the University and with a commitment for a promotion to associate professor\nwith an increase in salary. During her second year in Europe she also studied in\nG\u00a8ottingen.\n\nWhen Hazlett resumed her work at Illinois, she received the promised promotion\nand raise, but her teaching was less satisfying, since she wanted more work with\nadvanced students and less with elementary students. At this time her research\nproductivity diminished.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHAZLETT - 4\n\nHazlett\u2019s mother had broken her leg during the summer and remained in Rome\nafter Hazlett returned to Illinois. R. D. Carmichael, the department head at this\ntime, wrote to Olive B. Hazlett in early January 1931 informing her that her daugh-\nter had not been very well since her return to Illinois in September and that she\nhad not had energy for her research, but that she seemed to be improving. During\nthe following few years Hazlett remained in her position at Illinois. However, in a\nletter on December 11, 1936, Arthur B. Coble, the head of the mathematics de-\npartment, wrote to A. C. Willard, the university president that he was \u201cvery sorry\nto report that Professor Olive C. Hazlett has su\ufb00ered a nervous breakdown and\nthat her physician . . . says that in all likelihood she will not be able to resume her\nduties before June\u201d (Personnel \ufb01le, University of Illinois Department of Mathemat-\nics records). Hazlett was granted a leave of absence for illness December 1, 1936,\nthrough August 1937; the leave was with pay, but her salary was reduced to cover\nexpenses for her replacements. After about a week in the university hospital, she\nwas taken to Rogers Memorial Sanitarium in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin, where she\nremained for several months before spending some time in Chicago. In spring 1937\nshe asked to extend the leave of absence until September 1938, and the leave was\ngranted. In May 1937 a blow to Hazlett was the death of Herbert Slaught, the Uni-\nversity of Chicago mathematics professor in whose home Hazlett had lived her last\ntwo years at Chicago. Although Hazlett had asked for and received a leave without\npay, she found herself with \ufb01nancial troubles in autumn 1937, largely because she\nneeded to contribute to the support of her mother.\n\nHazlett spent most of the year 1937\u201338 in Colorado, \ufb01rst in Denver and then in\nEstes Park. Although Hazlett had no o\ufb03cial doctoral students, during the period\nthat she was on leave Donald Meeker Brown \ufb01nished his dissertation, Arithmetics of\nRational Generalized Quaternion Division Algebras, under the direction of Henry R.\nBrahana but wrote in the \u201cAcknowledgments\u201d of his \u201cappreciation of the guidance\nfurnished by Professor Olive C. Hazlett in preparing [him] for the solution of the\nproblem considered in this dissertation.\u201d\n\nHazlett returned to work at Illinois in September 1938. After a few years, how-\never, she was committed by court order on November 20, 1944, to the Neuropsy-\nchiatric Institute of the University of Illinois in Chicago. At some point she was\ngiven a conditional parole but was committed by the Champaign County Court\non March 13, 1945, to the Kankakee State Hospital in Kankakee, Illinois. She was\non a temporary disability leave with pay until May 1945, after which she was on\npermanent disability leave until her retirement in the late 1950s.\n\nIn 1953, with the help of a Kankakee physician and attorney, Hazlett petitioned\nfor her own release from the state hospital. A petition for a writ of habeas corpus\nwas \ufb01led on September 23, 1953, and after a hearing and evidence, the court found\nthe \u201cpetitioner not mentally ill and therefore illegally restrained of her liberties\u201d\n(Record 55, p. 344, \ufb01led October 2, 1953, Clerk of the Circuit Court, Kankakee\nCounty). She was discharged from custody after which she moved to her cabin,\nTimeless Lodge, in Peterborough, New Hampshire. Her mother died in Boston less\nthan a year later.\n\nOlive C. Hazlett was described by Lucretia Levy, a former colleague and o\ufb03ce\nmate for a year, as a kind and gentle lady and a pleasant o\ufb03ce mate who seemed\nvery much alone. Hazlett\u2019s interests were varied. In 1937 she described them as \u201crock\nclimbing especially above timberline and when the technique is pressure climbing;\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHAZLETT - 5\n\nlandscape photography, especially working across the light or into the light; Oriental\nrugs and other\u201d (Owens questionnaire). In about 1940 Hazlett described herself as a\nSocialist and as an Anglo-Catholic. After Hazlett moved to New Hampshire, she was\nbefriended by several local Discalced Carmelite brothers and was deeply involved\nas a lay woman in the order. At the time of her death she was a member of the\nCarmelite Third Order, an organization of lay people known as Tertiaries.\n\nAfter living in Peterborough for nearly two decades, Hazlett spent some months\nin a Keene, New Hampshire, nursing home before her death there at eighty-three\nin 1974. She was buried in Peterborough. In 1984 Olive C. Hazlett was one of three\nmathematicians whose lives were celebrated in Case-of-the-Month, \u201cCommemorat-\ning American Mathematics,\u201d exhibited in the Smithsonian Institution\u2019s National\nMuseum of American History.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Circ.

June 1, 1882\u2013September 18, 1952.\nUniversity of Missouri (BA 1903, MA 1904), Yale University (PhD 1909).\n\nMary Shore Walker was born in Wentzville, Missouri, the daughter of Harriett\nF. (Shore) (b. 1855) and Charles Joseph Walker (b. 1846), both of Missouri. At the\ntime of the 1900 census her parents had been married nineteen years, and \ufb01ve of\nsix children born were living. Mary Shore, seventeen, was the eldest, followed by\nCharles J., sixteen; Benjamin S., fourteen; Thomas L., ten; and Robert M., four. By\n1910 her father, an attorney, was widowed and had moved to Columbia, Missouri.\nMary Shore Walker went to Wentzville high school, just west of St. Louis, after\nwhich she entered Arkansas Industrial University (now University of Arkansas) in\n1889. After one year at Arkansas, she transferred to the University of Missouri and\nwas there from 1900 until 1907. She received her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1903 and\nher master\u2019s degree in 1904. From 1904 to 1907 she continued part-time graduate\nstudy and taught as an assistant in mathematics. She joined the AMS in April 1905\nand the following year participated in the preliminary meeting of the Southwestern\nSection of the AMS that was held in Columbia, Missouri.\n\nWalker\u2019s graduate work at Missouri included theory of numbers with Oliver D.\nKellogg, in\ufb01nite series and Galois theory of substitutions with L. D. Ames, real\nvariables and complex variables with E. R. Hedrick, di\ufb00erential equations with W.\nD. A. Westfall, Lie\u2019s theory of continuous groups with G. A. Bliss, Fourier\u2019s series\nand potential functions with L. M. DeFoe, projective geometry, and di\ufb00erential\ngeometry.\n\nIn 1907 Walker was appointed instructor at Missouri and was also granted a\nleave of absence to continue her studies. She was at the Yale graduate school for\nthe academic years 1907\u201308 and 1908\u201309 and had courses in di\ufb00erential equations\nand in integral equations with Max Mason, in geometrical analysis with P. F. Smith,\nelliptic functions and elementary and advanced theory of real variables with James\nPierpont, celestial mechanics with E. W. Brown, and advanced analytic geome-\ntry with E. G. Bill. She wrote her dissertation in analysis under the direction of\nPierpont. After receiving her PhD in 1909, Walker returned to the University of\nMissouri, where she was instructor of mathematics for two years.\n\nOn June 14, 1911, Mary Shore Walker and Albert Wallace Hull, a physicist, were\nmarried in Columbia, Missouri. Albert Hull was born in Connecticut on April 19,\n1880, and earned his BA in 1905 and his PhD in 1909 from Yale University. He was\na member of the physics department at Worcester Polytechnic Institute from 1909\nuntil 1914, when he joined the research sta\ufb00 of the General Electric Company as a\nphysicist at its research laboratory in Schenectady, New York.\n\nThe Hulls remained in Schenectady where, from 1928 until his retirement in\n1950, Albert Hull was assistant director of the laboratory. In the entry for him in\nthe National Cyclopedia of American Biography, it was written that he \u201cwas the\ndeveloper of possibly more types of electron tubes than any other man.\u201d Among\nhis many honors was election to the National Academy of Sciences. They had two\nchildren: Robert Wallace, born in 1917, and Harriet, born in 1919. Robert W. Hull\nearned a PhD in physics from MIT in 1943.\n\nMary S. W. Hull was active in a number of community organizations.

June 8, 1906\u2013April 14, 1966.\nBryn Mawr College (BA 1927), University of Michigan (MA 1935, PhD 1939).\n\nMargaret Elizabeth Pillsbury was born in Ann Arbor, Michigan, the elder of two\nchildren of Margaret May (Milbank) (1880\u20131972), born in New York, and Walter\nBowers Pillsbury (1872\u20131960), born in Iowa. Her mother earned a BA degree from\nthe University of Michigan in 1905, and her parents married in June of that year.\nHer father, who had received a BA from the University of Nebraska in 1892 and\na PhD from Cornell in 1896, was appointed to the department of philosophy and\npsychology at the University of Michigan in 1897. He became the chairman of\nthe psychology department when the disciplines were separated in the 1920s and\nremained on the faculty at Michigan until his retirement in 1942. His interests lay\nprimarily in reasoning and attention; he was starred in the \ufb01fth edition of American\nMen of Science and was a member of the National Academy of Sciences. A son,\nWalter Milbank, was born in 1919 in Ann Arbor, held an MBA from Harvard\nUniversity, was a management o\ufb03cer with the US Department of the Army, and\ndied in 1969 in Washington, D.C.\n\nAfter Elizabeth Pillsbury\u2019s graduation from Ann Arbor High School, she entered\nBryn Mawr College. While there she held a James E. Rhoads junior scholarship and\nthree scholarships her senior year: the Charles S. Hinchman memorial scholarship,\nthe Elizabeth S. Shippen scholarship in science, and the Elizabeth Wilson White\nmemorial scholarship. Pillsbury graduated summa cum laude in mathematics and\nchemistry in 1927.\n\nElizabeth Pillsbury \ufb01rst enrolled at the University of Michigan in the summer\nof 1927. She also studied at G\u00a8ottingen in 1927 and in Berlin in 1928. From 1928\nto 1932 she was a graduate student in chemistry at the University of California\nin Berkeley. Also during this period she married, in 1930, Warren Phelps Baxter,\nborn in Montreal in 1901, a chemist who had received a PhD from the California\nInstitute of Technology in 1928. In 1930 he was a chemist for Shell Development, the\nresearch division of Shell Oil Company, in Emeryville, near Berkeley, California. In\n1949, while employed by National Technical Laboratories in South Pasadena, he and\na colleague patented a glass electrode to measure pH in highly alkaline solutions.\nElizabeth and Warren Baxter had a daughter, Margaret Elizabeth, in 1934, and a\nson, John Walter, in 1939.\n\nIn summer 1935 Baxter enrolled as a candidate for a master\u2019s degree in math-\nematics at the University of Michigan. Since she was given credit for some of her\nwork at California, she received the master\u2019s degree from Michigan in 1935. She con-\ntinued her work there in the academic year 1935\u201336, the summers of 1936 and 1937,\nand part time in the second semester of 1937\u201338. She completed her dissertation in\n1938 and received the PhD from Michigan in February 1939.\n\nFrom 1945 to 1947 Elizabeth Baxter worked as a research analyst for the Douglas\nAircraft Company. In 1947 she was hired by the Jet Propulsion Laboratory at the\nCalifornia Institute of Technology. The following year she registered for a three-day\nsymposium on modern calculating machinery and numerical methods that provided\nthe participants information about then current ultra-high-speed numerical calcu-\nlation.

September 29, 1868\u2013May 15, 1907.\nWellesley College (BS 1890), Georg-Augusts-Universit\u00a8at G\u00a8ottingen (PhD\n1900).\n\nAnne Lucy Bosworth was born in Woonsocket, Rhode Island, the only surviving\nchild of Ellen (Metcalf) (1843\u20131929) and Alfred Bosworth (b. ca. 1846), both from\nRhode Island. It appears that her mother was widowed some time in the early 1870s.\nMrs. Ellen Bosworth was working at the Harris Institute Library in Woonsocket in\n1874; in 1880 she was described as a librarian, and she, her sister, and Anne were\nliving with Anne\u2019s maternal grandmother in Woonsocket. In the early 1890s, Ellen\nBosworth and her sister were living at the same address.\n\nAfter attending public schools in Woonsocket, Anne Bosworth entered Wellesley\nCollege in 1886 and graduated in 1890, in the same class as Grace Andrews, Clara\nLatimer Bacon, and the mother of Dorothy Kohlmetz.\n\nBosworth spent the two years after her graduation from Wellesley as a high\nschool teacher in Amesbury, Massachusetts, before moving, in 1892, to Rhode Island\nCollege of Agricultural and Mechanical Arts (now University of Rhode Island) in\nKingston as professor of mathematics. It was in 1892 that the college \ufb01rst o\ufb00ered\ninstruction at the postsecondary level. During the summer quarters of 1894, 1896,\nand 1897, she studied with E. H. Moore and Oskar Bolza at the University of\nChicago.\n\nIn April 1898, Anne Bosworth was granted a year\u2019s leave from Rhode Island\nCollege for study in G\u00a8ottingen. That summer she attended Felix Klein\u2019s lectures in\nMechanik, along with Emilie Norton Martin and Virginia Ragsdale, both graduates\nof Bryn Mawr College, who had studied at G\u00a8ottingen the previous winter as well.\nWhile at G\u00a8ottingen, Bosworth also heard lectures by Arthur Sch\u00a8on\ufb02ies, Issai Schur,\nand Woldemar Voigt. In the winter semester 1898\u201399, Bosworth attended David\nHilbert\u2019s lectures on Euclidean geometry; it was from these that she derived the\nbasis for her subsequent dissertation work. Her daughter recalled in 1978:\n\nAccording to my grandmother, [my mother] had no plan for a doc-\ntorate \u2013 just a year\u2019s study. . . .\n\nIn the spring she was \u201csummoned\u201d to tea with her professor,\n& she dressed her best, gloves, hat & all. After a ceremonial tea,\nher professor asked her when she expected to take her doctoral\nexaminations. She said she had not any such intention, had not\neven thought of a dissertation topic! The professor said, \u201cBut your\ndissertation is \ufb01nished\u201d(!). It appeared she had done a special ex-\nercise for him, and it was considered an entirely original approach\n& acceptable as a thesis. So instead of spending her summer trav-\nelling in Italy, Greece, etc. she remained at G\u00a8ottingen & took her\nexams & and passed with honor.\n\nBosworth took her oral examination on July 31, 1899, just over a year after she\nhad arrived in Germany, and, accompanied by her mother, returned to the United\nStates in August 1899. According to Renate Tobies, Hilbert assessed Bosworth\u2019s dis-\nsertation as \u201ceine t\u00a8uchtige und selbst\u00a8andige Leistung von wissenschaftlichen Werte\u201d\n[a sound and independent achievement of scienti\ufb01c value] (our translation) (p. 136).\nThe PhD from G\u00a8ottingen was awarded in 1900. She became a member of the AMS\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nFOCKE - 2\n\nat about that time. In 1901, G. B. Halsted referred to her dissertation in a sup-\nplementary report to his bibliography on non-Euclidean geometry that was \ufb01rst\npublished in 1878. He wrote that her dissertation \u201cis a beautiful piece of non-\nEuclidean geometry, and is, so far as I know, the \ufb01rst feminine contribution to our\nfascinating subject\u201d (Amer. Math. Monthly 228, Science 715).\n\nBosworth then returned to Rhode Island College and remained for the next two\nyears, living with her mother in Kingston. While in G\u00a8ottingen, however, she had\nmet Theodore Moses Focke, who studied mathematics and physics there 1896\u201398\nand received his PhD in 1898. On August 7, 1901, they were married in Kingston,\nRhode Island. Theodore Focke was born on January 3, 1871, in Massillon, Ohio, and\nwas an 1892 graduate of the Case School of Applied Science (later Case Institute of\nTechnology, now Case Western Reserve University) in Cleveland. After his studies\nabroad, he returned to Case Institute of Technology, where he was an instructor of\nmathematics and civil engineering at the time of his marriage.\n\nAnne Bosworth Focke left her position in Rhode Island and moved to Cleveland.\nHer daughter reported in 1978: \u201cAfter their marriage, Mother did not teach again,\nbut worked with Father, grading papers, being a good faculty wife, & having three\nchildren, of whom I am the oldest.\u201d The children were: Helen Metcalf, born June\n10, 1902; Theodore Brown, born September 16, 1904; and Alfred Bosworth, born\nSeptember 30, 1906.\n\nOn May 15 1907, Anne Bosworth Focke died at age thirty-eight of pneumonia,\nwhen her children were not quite \ufb01ve, three, and one. She was buried in Massillon,\nOhio, her husband\u2019s birthplace. In 1910 her mother and aunt were both living in\nthe Focke household in Cleveland.\n\nTheodore M. Focke became Kerr professor of mathematics and head of the de-\npartment at Case School of Applied Science in 1908 and then served as dean of the\nfaculty from 1918 until his retirement in 1944, when he was awarded an honorary\ndoctorate by that institution. He died on March 1, 1949. After earning a BA in\nchemistry and an MA in geology from Western Reserve University, Helen Focke\nremained there and received a BS in library science; she spent most of her career\non the faculty of the School of Library Science of Case Western Reserve. She died in\nOctober 1997. Theodore Brown Focke received a DSc from the University of Nancy\nin France and, after serving as an engineer and then as an executive for various\ncompanies, was the president and director of a tire sales company in Johnstown,\nPennsylvania. Alfred Bosworth Focke received a PhD in physics from the Califor-\nnia Institute of Technology and ended his career as professor and chairman of the\nphysics department of Harvey Mudd College. Theodore Brown Focke and Alfred\nBosworth Focke died within three days of each other in June 1986.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liation: AMS.\n\nDissertation:\n1899 [Bosworth, A.

      "text": "WHEELER, Anna (Johnson) Pell. May 5, 1883\u2013March 26, 1966.\nUniversity of South Dakota (BA 1903), University of Iowa (MA 1904), Rad-\ncliffe College (MA 1905), University of Chicago (PhD 1910).\n\nAnna Johnson was born in Calliope (now Hawarden), Iowa, the youngest of three sur-\nviving children of four born to Amelia (Friberg or Frieberg) (1854\u20131935) and Andrew\nGustav Johnson (1846\u20131920), both from Skaraborgl\u00a8an, W\u00a8asterg\u00a8otland, Sweden. Her par-\nents had each immigrated to the United States in 1872, married several years after their\narrival, and settled in Union Creek in Dakota Territory. Her father \ufb01rst farmed but later\nwas a furniture dealer and undertaker. Her sister, Esther Carolina (1879\u20131979), and her\nbrother, Elmer (b. 1881), were both born in Dakota Territory. In 1882 the family moved\nto Iowa, \ufb01rst Calliope and then, in about 1891, to nearby Akron. Anna Johnson attended\npublic school in Akron and graduated from high school there in 1899. According to Esther\nJohnson\u2019s granddaughter Nancy J. Owens, who spoke at an AWM-sponsored symposium\nin honor of her great aunt, Amelia Johnson regretted not having received an education\nand sent her two daughters, but not her son, to college.\n\nIn 1899 Anna Johnson entered the University of South Dakota in Vermillion, about\ntwenty-\ufb01ve miles from Akron; her sister, Esther, had entered the previous year. Anna\n\ufb01rst took courses that allowed her to complete the formal entrance requirements of the\nschool. When the census was taken in early June 1900, she was enumerated as a boarder\nin Vermillion and with her family in Akron, where her father was a furniture dealer, her\nsister was a school teacher, and her brother was a day laborer.\n\nAnna Johnson continued her studies at South Dakota, where her mathematical talent\nwas recognized by Alexander Pell, who \u201cfound his prodigy\u201d after seeing her approach to\nan original geometry problem he had assigned (Hardesty and Unruh, \u201cThe Enigma of\nDegaev-Pell,\u201d 17). Pell and his wife, Emma, took several students, among them Anna and\nEsther Johnson, into their home to live.\n\nWith Pell\u2019s strong encouragement, Johnson graduated from South Dakota in 1903 and\nwent to the University of Iowa on a scholarship. She received her master\u2019s degree in 1904\nand then went to Radcli\ufb00e College with a scholarship. She received her second master\u2019s\ndegree in 1905. Still on scholarship she stayed at Radcli\ufb00e until 1906, when she went to the\nuniversity in G\u00a8ottingen on an Alice Freeman Palmer fellowship from Wellesley College.\nOn July 9, 1907, she married Alexander Pell in G\u00a8ottingen. Pell\u2019s \ufb01rst wife had died in\nDecember 1904, and he and Johnson had remained in contact over the years.\n\nPell was born Sergei Petrovich Degaev in 1857 in Moscow, Russia. After attending\nmilitary schools Degaev received an army commission in 1876. He retired from the service\nin 1879 and entered engineering school in St. Petersburg. Toward the end of 1880 he joined\nthe People\u2019s Will, a group that was responsible for the assassination of Tsar Alexander\nII in March 1881. Degaev was among those arrested but was released a few weeks later.\nHe graduated in June and married Liubov Nikolavena Ivanova in November 1881. His\nsubsequent activities in, and escape from, Tsarist Russian were described in a 1972 article,\n\u201cThe Enigma of Degaev-Pell,\u201d and were more fully depicted in a 2003 monograph, The\nDegaev A\ufb00air. In November 1882 Degaev was sent to Odessa by the People\u2019s Will to\nset up a printing press and was soon arrested there. He contacted the head of the secret\npolice, Georgii Sudeikin, hoping, according to his sister, \u201cto achieve revolutionary goals\nthrough the government\u201d (Pipes, The Degaev A\ufb03ar, 67); he became a collaborator and\nwas allowed to escape. However, upon the arrest of many members of the People\u2019s Will,\nDegaev confessed his collaboration to this group, promised to assassinate Sudeikin, and\ndid so in December 1883. After the assassination Degaev was expelled from the People\u2019s\nWill but was o\ufb00ered money to travel to America. Furthermore, in February 1884 the\nRussian authorities circulated a poster with his picture and o\ufb00ered a signi\ufb01cant reward.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWHEELER - 2\n\nDegaev and his wife \ufb02ed to England and then came to North America. This part of his\nlife was described in a 1921 obituary by Charlotte Scott:\n\nHis early history is that of so many of his compatriots in that sorely\ndisturbed country, driven into futile revolutionary courses by his patri-\notism and forced by failure to leave his native land. . . . Apparently he\nwent from place to place, doing whatever he could \ufb01nd to do; one of his\nearliest jobs was in a printing o\ufb03ce in a small Canadian village. These\nearly struggles must have occupied a few years before he went to St.\nLouis, where he secured a position in a chemical factory in 1886. (\u201cDr.\nAlexander Pell,\u201d Bryn Mawr College News, 9 Feb 1921, 2)\n\nIn 1891 Degaev and his wife, using the names Alexander and Emma Pell, became US\ncitizens, and Alexander Pell began his study of mathematics at Washington University in\nSt. Louis under the direction of C. M. Woodward. He began graduate studies at Johns\nHopkins University in 1895 and was awarded his PhD in 1897. He was appointed pro-\nfessor at South Dakota that year and not long afterwards had Anna Johnson as a pupil.\nThus, despite \u201chis constant fear of revolutionary retribution\u201d (Pipes, 119), Pell traveled\nto G\u00a8ottingen in the summer of 1907 in order to marry his prot\u00b4eg\u00b4e. Both Alexander and\nAnna Pell returned to the United States in August.\n\nThe year 1907 also marked the opening of the University of South Dakota\u2019s School of\nEngineering and the appointment of Pell as its \ufb01rst dean. Anna J. Pell taught at South\nDakota during the fall semester of 1907 and returned alone to G\u00a8ottingen in the spring\nof 1908. In August 1908, Alexander Pell, who had been starred in the 1906 edition of\nAmerican Men of Science, resigned from his position as dean of the College of Engineering\nat South Dakota and took a position as an assistant professor at the Armour Institute of\nTechnology (now Illinois Institute of Technology) in Chicago. In December 1908, when she\nwas almost ready to take her \ufb01nal examination with David Hilbert in G\u00a8ottingen, Anna\nJ. Pell returned to the United States without her degree and in January 1909 enrolled at\nthe University of Chicago.\n\nAnna J. Pell received her PhD magna cum laude in 1910 from the University of Chicago.\nWhile she was o\ufb03cially a student of E. H. Moore, she wrote at the time that her disser-\ntation, in the new \ufb01eld of functional analysis, had been written independently while in\nG\u00a8ottingen. Moore was unable to secure Anna Pell a position at a research institution, so\nshe remained in Chicago and taught a class at the university during the fall. In January\n1911, Alexander Pell, by then an associate professor at the Armour Institute, su\ufb00ered a\nstroke while teaching. Anna J. Pell substituted for her husband for the remainder of the\nsemester. His only teaching after the stroke was for a semester at Northwestern University\nin 1915\u201316.\n\nIn the fall of 1911 Anna Pell became an instructor at Mount Holyoke College in Mas-\nsachusetts. In 1914 she was promoted to associate professor. Four years later she moved\nto Bryn Mawr College as associate professor to \ufb01ll the vacancy created when Olive C.\nHazlett went to Mount Holyoke College. Bryn Mawr, whose mathematics department was\nheaded by Charlotte A. Scott, had a more active department than Mount Holyoke and\nalso had a PhD program. The department\u2019s journal club met regularly, and Anna Pell was\nan active participant, often giving both the \ufb01rst and last talks of the semester.\n\nEarly in 1921 Alexander Pell died. That same year the third edition of American Men\nof Science appeared with Anna J. Pell starred. The following year, Anna Pell\u2019s \ufb01rst PhD\nstudent, Margaret Buchanan (Cole), earned her degree. In 1923 Pell was appointed to the\nAmerican Mathematical Society\u2019s committee on policy and budget. Later that year the\nAMS was incorporated and she was appointed to the original board of trustees, which\nconsisted of thirty-one members; Anna J. Pell and Clara E. Smith of Wellesley College\nwere the only women on the board. While neither Pell nor Smith was elected in 1924 to\nthe smaller \ufb01ve-member board of trustees, Pell was elected to serve on the council of the\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWHEELER - 3\n\nAMS for 1924\u201326. Also, in 1923 Pell became the \ufb01rst woman to deliver an invited address\nat a meeting of the AMS; the next was delivered by Emmy Noether in 1934.\n\nPell became head of the department after Charlotte Scott\u2019s retirement in 1924. She was\nnamed Alumnae Professor of Mathematics the following year. In July 1925 she married\nArthur Leslie Wheeler (1861\u20131932), a Connecticut-born, Yale-educated classicist who had\nbeen on the faculty at Bryn Mawr since 1900 and who was widowed before Pell joined the\nBryn Mawr faculty. Before their marriage, Arthur Wheeler had accepted a professorship\nat Princeton University. Their marriage was announced in the Bulletin of the AMS, which\nnotes, \u201cthey will continue to occupy their professorships and they will be at home after\nthis fall in Princeton and in Bryn Mawr\u201d (31 (1925): 573). Shortly before her marriage\nto Wheeler, Anna Pell made a contribution in honor of Alexander Pell to the society\u2019s\nendowment fund.\n\nIn 1927 D. V. Widder, an associate on the Bryn Mawr mathematics faculty, was pro-\nmoted to associate professor, thus allowing Anna Pell Wheeler to become a non-resident\nlecturer, teach only part time, and live full time in Princeton, New Jersey. She continued\nthis arrangement for the next four years except for a year spent in Europe. While still\nliving in Princeton, she returned to her professorship in 1931 when Widder, who later mar-\nried one of Wheeler\u2019s doctoral students, left for a position at Harvard. The following year\nArthur Wheeler died and Anna Pell Wheeler moved back to Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania.\n\nWhile she was married to Arthur Wheeler, Anna Pell Wheeler was particularly active\nin both the AMS and the MAA. In addition to \ufb01nishing her term on the AMS council,\nin 1926 she served on the \ufb01rst MAA Chauvenet Prize committee and the following year\nbegan a \ufb01fteen-year appointment as an associate editor of the Annals of Mathematics\nrepresenting the MAA. She directed three dissertations while she lived in Princeton (Mar-\nion Cameron Gray 1926, Laura Guggenb\u00a8uhl 1927, and Rose Lucile Anderson 1930). In\n1927 Wheeler became the \ufb01rst woman to deliver the AMS colloquium lectures; the next\nby a woman were delivered in 1980 by Julia Robinson. Wheeler\u2019s lectures do not appear\nin the Colloquium Publication Series although after Arthur Wheeler\u2019s death she appar-\nently planned to rewrite them in book form. After his death in 1932, Anna Pell Wheeler\npublished only one more paper, that in 1935.\n\nAfter Wheeler\u2019s return to full-time teaching, Bryn Mawr joined the University of Penn-\nsylvania and Swarthmore College in a cooperative plan for graduate study. Wheeler hired\nstrong research faculty during the 1930s. Gustav A. Hedlund was at Bryn Mawr from 1930\nto 1939; Emmy Noether joined the Bryn Mawr faculty in 1933, became a close friend of\nWheeler, and remained until her death in April 1935; Nathan Jacobson stayed only 1935\u2013\n36; and Hilda Geiringer came in 1939 and stayed until 1944, leaving soon after marrying\nRichard von Mises of Harvard. During this period Wheeler supervised four more disserta-\ntions (Olive Margaret Hughes 1934, Vera Ames (Widder) 1938, Dorothy Maharam (Stone)\n1940, and Josephine Mitchell (1942). She also served on the College Entrance Examina-\ntion Board Commission on Examinations in Mathematics that was appointed in 1933 and\nreported early in 1935. Later she served several terms on the AMS committee to deter-\nmine the use of interest accrued from special funds and was chairman of the Philadelphia\nSection of the MAA in 1944.\n\nTwo women\u2019s colleges, New Jersey College for Women and Mount Holyoke College,\nawarded Wheeler honorary DSc degrees, in 1932 and 1937, respectively. Letters written\nat the time of her retirement in 1948 and talks given at a symposium about her life and\nwork in 1980 indicate that she treated her students and young faculty to the same type of\ncare and encouragement that she had received from Alexander and Emma Pell when she\nwas a student. In 2006 Anna Pell Wheeler was one of forty-\ufb01ve women mathematicians\nfeatured with an individual poster containing a brief biography at the \u201cConnecting Women\nin Mathematics Across Canada\u201d workshop held at the Fields Institute. She and Grace\nBareis were the only two women in our study so honored.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWHEELER - 4\n\nAfter her retirement Anna Pell Wheeler continued to live in Bryn Mawr but spent\nsummers in a cottage, named QED, that she and Arthur Wheeler had bought in St.\nHubert\u2019s, New York, in the Adirondack Mountains. She also spent some time in northern\nCalifornia, attending section meetings of the MAA in San Francisco in January 1949 and\n1951. In 1953 she endowed a mathematics scholarship at the University of South Dakota\nhonoring Alexander Pell. In 1960 anonymous gifts in honor of Anna Pell Wheeler and in\nmemory of Charlotte Angas Scott established funds for prizes awarded annually in their\nnames. Anna Pell Wheeler was eighty-two when she died in Bryn Mawr in March 1966\na few months after su\ufb00ering a stroke.

August 15, 1896\u2013January 14, 1974.\nUniversity of Nebraska (BA 1916, MA 1919), University of Chicago (PhD\n1923).\n\nConstance Juliet Rummons was born in Lincoln, Nebraska, the daughter of Clara\n(Schroeder) (1871\u20131964), born in Illinois, and Nestor Rummons (1869\u20131929), a\nnative of Missouri. Her mother was a homemaker and legal secretary; her father\nwas a lawyer, who had graduated from Central Wesleyan College in Missouri in\n1887 and from the College of Law at the University of Michigan in 1890. A year or\ntwo after their 1895 marriage, the family moved from Lincoln to Elwood, Nebraska,\nand in 1901 to Hobart, Oklahoma. Her father was a member of the Oklahoma State\nSupreme Court Commission 1915\u201319. She had two younger sisters, Lucy (1898\u2013ca.\n1901) and Helen Lacy (1906\u20131988), who graduated from the University of Nebraska\nin 1925, received a master\u2019s degree in classical studies from the University of Chicago\nin 1927, and became a teacher of Latin, Greek, and English in a Chicago high school.\nCensus records indicate that her parents were living apart in Hobart, Oklahoma, in\n1910 and that they were divorced by 1920, when Clara Rummons and her daughters\nwere living in Lincoln, Nebraska.\n\nConstance Rummons entered the University of Nebraska in 1912 and received\nher bachelor of arts degree at the midwinter commencement of 1915\u201316. She also\ntook some teachers\u2019 courses and in the summer session of 1916 earned the teachers\u2019\ncollege diploma and the university teachers\u2019 certi\ufb01cate. She was a graduate student\nin 1916\u201317 and an assistant in philosophy 1917\u201319 before receiving her master\u2019s\ndegree in May 1919 in philosophy and English literature. She was a member of the\nhonorary literary society Chi Delta Phi, and her master\u2019s thesis appeared in the\nseries University of Nebraska Studies in Language, Literature, and Criticism. Three\nyears later, a year before she received her PhD in mathematics, Rummons published\na lengthy article in a poetry journal. Rummons was a graduate student, presum-\nably in mathematics, at Nebraska 1919\u201321 and was also an assistant instructor in\nmathematics 1920\u201321, having studied at the University of Chicago in the summer\nof 1920. She returned to Chicago for summer 1922 and the three quarters of the\nacademic year 1922\u201323. She received her PhD from Chicago in 1923.\n\nWhile Rummons was at Chicago, she met John Perry Ballantine, a fellow gradu-\nate student there; they were married at her mother\u2019s home in Lincoln, Nebraska, on\nSeptember 21, 1922. J. P. Ballantine was born February 23, 1896, in Rahuri, India.\nHis father was a medical missionary and his mother was a teacher who had taught\nin South Africa. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Harvard in 1918 and was an\ninstructor at the University of Maine 1919\u201320, at Pennsylvania State College 1920\u2013\n21, and at the University of Michigan 1921\u201322. He, too, received his PhD from the\nUniversity of Chicago in 1923, with a dissertation, \u201cA Postulational Introduction\nto the Four Color Problem,\u201d directed by E. H. Moore.\n\nIn 1923 the Ballantines moved to New York City, where J. P. Ballantine had a\nposition as instructor at Columbia University 1923\u201326. Constance Ballantine was\nan instructor at Washington Square College, New York University, 1924\u201325. On\nAugust 31, 1926, the \ufb01rst of their three children, Julia Gay, was born in Lincoln,\nNebraska. That same year they moved to Seattle where J. P. Ballantine began\nhis work at the University of Washington. He was assistant professor 1926\u201330,\nassociate professor 1930\u201338, and professor 1938\u201366, before his retirement in 1966.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBALLANTINE - 2\n\nDuring World War II, he served with the US Army at American military schools\nin England and Germany.\n\nThe second child, Frederick Winthrop, was born September 18, 1927, and the\nthird, Charles Standish, on August 27, 1929, both in Seattle. All the children sub-\nsequently had professional careers. Julia B. Zalokar became an epidemiologist and\nhomemaker after receiving her education at the University of Washington; Columbia\nUniversity Medical School; University of Washington Medical School; San Diego\nState University, where she earned a master\u2019s degree; and the University of Cali-\nfornia, San Diego. She died in 1997.\n\nFrederick W. became a computer programmer after attending the University\nof Washington and the University of Illinois and earning a master\u2019s degree. He\ndied in 2006. Charles S. became a mathematician, having received his BS from the\nUniversity of Washington and his PhD from Stanford. He retired from Oregon State\nUniversity as professor emeritus. He died in 2008.\n\nWithin two years of moving to Seattle, Constance Ballantine was given the ti-\ntle of associate at the University of Washington. She held the title, which appears\nto have carried no speci\ufb01c duties, at least until 1950. Although she taught some\ncorrespondence courses, according to her younger son, anti-nepotism practices, es-\npecially during the Great Depression, played an inhibiting role in her pursuit of\nprofessional work. However, she did write a review for the Monthly in 1939. When\nthe children were in school she was active in the PTA. Her hobbies were gardening,\nreading, word puzzles, bridge, and Scrabble. She was a member of the University\nUnitarian Church.\n\nJ. P.

August 20, 1905\u2013November 28, 2004.\nWestern College for Women (BA 1926), University of Chicago (MS 1931, PhD\n1933).\n\nAnna Adelaide Sta\ufb00ord was born in Chicago, Illinois, the eldest of six children\nof Caroline (Fleuchaus) (ca. 1882\u20131919) and Richard W. Sta\ufb00ord (1881\u20131919). Her\nparents were born in Chicago, and both had a high school education; they married\nin 1904. At the time of the 1910 census they were living in Chicago, where her\nfather was manager of a pickle factory. Later he managed lumber companies. Her\nbrother, Richard W. (1907\u20131962), was born in St. Paul, Minnesota; her two sisters,\nMabelle L. (1910\u20131977) and Marcia Frances (1912\u20131991), were born in Chicago;\nand her younger brother, Wirt W. (1914\u20131992), was born in Marsh\ufb01eld, Wisconsin.\nAll were college graduates. Her youngest brother, Walter, died in infancy.\n\nAfter her parents died in 1919, the \ufb01ve surviving Sta\ufb00ord children lived with her\nfather\u2019s sister and her family, \ufb01rst in St. Louis, Missouri, and later in Chicago. Anna\nSta\ufb00ord attended public schools in Chicago; Marsh\ufb01eld, Wisconsin; and Barnum,\nMinnesota, before graduating in 1922 from Frank Louis Soldan High School in St.\nLouis. She attended Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio, with a four-year\ncollege scholarship and an AAUW scholarship from the St. Louis AAUW. While\nthere, her majors were mathematics and Greek and her minor was French. She was\nin the classical club, the French club, and the mathematics club; she participated\nin theater; and she successfully participated in enough sports, baseball, hockey,\nbasketball, and swimming, to earn a blue \u201cW.\u201d In her college yearbook she is listed\nas from Evanston, Illinois.\n\nFollowing her graduation from Western College in 1926, Sta\ufb00ord taught mathe-\nmatics and science for two years at St. John Baptist School, an Episcopal school for\ngirls in New York and later in Mendham, New Jersey. She taught at the Darlington\nSeminary in West Chester, Pennsylvania, 1928\u201329 and at St. John Baptist School\nin Mendham 1929\u201331. During the summers 1927\u201329, 1931, and 1933, she attended\ngraduate school at the University of Chicago. From 1931 to 1933 she completed two\nyears of residency at Chicago; she earned her master\u2019s degree in December 1931 and\nher PhD in August 1933 as a student of Mayme I. Logsdon. Her dissertation was\nin topology, a subject that had caught her attention upon hearing a lecture by\nRaymond Wilder of the University of Michigan. However, there were no topology\nspecialists at Chicago, so she and Logsdon worked through the material together,\nlearning Italian to do so.\n\nFrom 1933 to 1935 Sta\ufb00ord was a member of the Institute for Advanced Study\nat Princeton, where she pursued her interest in topology. She was one of two women\nwho went to the IAS in 1933; the other was Mabel Schmeiser (Barnes). In the same\nperiod, Sta\ufb00ord was on the faculty at St. John Baptist School, where she taught in\nthe mornings, so she could attend lectures at the Institute in the afternoons. From\n1935 to 1937 she was an instructor at the University of Nebraska. While there\nshe published an article that ended with a bibliography of works that would aid\nteachers in making the mathematics curriculum more interesting; the list included\nMayme Logsdon\u2019s A Mathematician Explains and Helen Merrill\u2019s Mathematical\nExcursions. In the summer following her \ufb01rst year of teaching, Sta\ufb00ord traveled in\nEurope, where she attended the International Congress of Mathematicians at Oslo\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHENRIQUES - 2\n\nand visited England, Holland, Norway, Sweden, Denmark, Germany, Switzerland,\nand France.\n\nIn 1937 Sta\ufb00ord joined the faculty at the University of Utah in Salt Lake City\nwhere she remained for nearly twenty years. Also that fall Harriet Rees (Bonner),\nwho had just earned her doctorate from Chicago, was appointed instructor at Utah\nand served for a year and a half. In 1942 Anna Sta\ufb00ord married Douglas E. Hen-\nriques, whom she had met in a church choir. He was born in Nevada in 1910 and was\nan administrative law judge for the US Department of the Interior. He had a twelve-\nyear-old son by a previous marriage, Vico Emanuel, who became the president of the\nComputer and Business Equipment Manufacturers\u2019 Association (CBEMA). They\nlater adopted a daughter, Virginia, a member of the Navajo Nation who was born\nin Blu\ufb00, Utah, and became a practical nurse.\n\nAt the University of Utah, Anna Sta\ufb00ord Henriques was instructor 1937\u201341,\nassistant professor 1941\u201347, and associate professor 1947\u201356. In 1946 she revived\nthe mathematics club, which had become moribund some years earlier. She had a\nsabbatical leave during the spring quarter 1949 during which she taught one class\nwhile preparing a textbook for it. About the same time she wrote, but apparently\nnever published, a paper entitled, \u201cSome mathematical aspects of modern life.\u201d In\na 1997 interview, Tom Apostol remarked that his \u201cbest mathematics teacher [at\nthe University of Utah] was Anna Henriques\u201d (Albers and Apostol, 258).\n\nIn 1956 Douglas Henriques\u2019s work took him from Utah to New Mexico, and\nso the family moved. In 1957 Anna Henriques became a lecturer at St. Michael\u2019s\nCollege (the College of Santa Fe since 1966). Two years later she also became a\nlecturer at the University of New Mexico and remained in both positions until\n1962 when she became professor at St. Michael\u2019s. She retired in 1971 as professor\nemeritus. Shortly thereafter she and her husband were living in the Falls Church\narea of Fairfax County, Virginia, where they remained. Once retired, Douglas and\nAnna Henriques traveled, making trips to every continent.\n\nAnna Henriques delivered several papers to professional organizations of which\nshe was a member: the MAA, the NCTM, the Utah Council of Teachers of Math-\nematics (UCTM), and the Utah Academy of Sciences, Arts, and Letters. She held\nmany positions in the Utah and New Mexico branches of AAUW and served as pres-\nident, program director, and bulletin editor of the UCTM. She was also a member\nof Delta Kappa Gamma, a women\u2019s education honor society. She was involved with\nthe Girl Scouts in 1955. During her lifetime her interests included mountain climb-\ning, hiking, bowling, opera, theater, and travel. She was a generous contributor to\nthe MAA and the IAS.\n\nDouglas Henriques died in November 1987. Anna Henriques later moved to Good-\nwin House Bailey\u2019s Crossroads, a retirement community in the Falls Church area,\nand died there of congestive heart failure in 2004 at ninety-nine. She was survived\nby her step-son, Vico Henriques, two granddaughters, and \ufb01ve great-grandchildren.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, ASL, NCTM, AAAS, AAUW, Sigma Xi,\nSigma Delta Epsilon, Pi Mu Epsilon.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1931 [Sta\ufb00ord, A.

Her parents, neither of whom\nhad attended college, married on December 30, 1896, and her mother died three\ndays after giving birth to their second daughter, Elsie [or Elise] Green Wiggin, in\nSeptember 1905. Her father remarried in 1908.\n\nEvelyn Wiggin received her early education at Robinson Seminary, a public\nsecondary school in Exeter, New Hampshire, before entering Wellesley College in\n1917. While at Wellesley she was a Durant scholar. After her graduation as a\nmathematics major in 1921, she taught mathematics at the high school in Massena,\nNew York, during 1921\u201322.\n\nOn March 28, 1922, Wiggin received a letter from R. G. D. Richardson at Brown\nUniversity, who, at the suggestion of \u201cmy good friends, Misses [Helen A.] Merrill\nand [Clara E.] Smith at Wellesley,\u201d invited her to apply for a position as a graduate\nassistant in the department at Brown University (Correspondence 1921\u20131925, R. G.\nD. Richardson Papers, Brown University Archives). He wanted someone to assist\nhim half time and indicated that there was also the opportunity to study toward\nthe MA degree. He noted that there were usually four or \ufb01ve students studying\nfor master\u2019s degrees each year, half of whom were women \u2013 chie\ufb02y from Women\u2019s\nCollege, Brown. Wiggin entered Brown in 1922 and was to serve as Richardson\u2019s\nassistant, which involved reading papers and keeping department records; she also\nwas to teach a section of students who had entered with only one year of algebra. In\naddition, for an extra stipend, she was to teach a class of girls de\ufb01cient in algebra\nduring the \ufb01rst semester and those de\ufb01cient in plane geometry during the second\nsemester. Two years later, in 1924, she completed her master\u2019s degree having taken\nwork mainly with Richardson and Raymond Clare Archibald.\n\nWiggin was an instructor of mathematics at Hood College in Frederick, Mary-\nland, from September 1924 until June 1927. On October 16, 1924, in reply to a\nnote from her, Richardson wrote, \u201cI know that you will not forget the intellectual\nideal which inspired you to go on with graduate work\u201d (Richardson Correspon-\ndence 1921\u20131925). Richardson continued to encourage Wiggin to pursue the study\nof mathematics. On October 9, 1925, after she reported to him on extra duties at\nHood because of illness of a colleague\u2019s mother, duties that resulted in twenty-one\nhours of teaching and looking after the department, he wrote, \u201cIf you care to take\nsome course for credit in absentia here at Brown, I think it could be arranged. I\nknow you will want to keep on with your studies in some sort of way. Possibly you\ncan go to Chicago some summer\u201d (Richardson Correspondence 1921\u20131925). Wiggin\nleft Hood College in 1927 to enter the University of Chicago for further graduate\nwork. She was \ufb01rst there for two years, as a teaching fellow in her second year,\n1928\u201329, working mainly with Gilbert Ames Bliss.\n\nIn 1929 Wiggin joined the faculty of Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College in Lynch-\nburg, Virginia, as an associate professor. (The college was renamed Randolph\nCollege and became coeducational in 2007.) Except for leaves she remained at\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCASNER - 2\n\nRandolph-Macon the rest of her career. Gillie Larew was also on the faculty, al-\nthough in Wiggin\u2019s \ufb01rst year there, Larew was on leave to study with Carath\u00b4eodory\nin Munich. In a letter to Bliss of March 31, 1931, Larew commented about Wiggin:\n\u201cI want to thank you again for sending us Miss Wiggin and express the hope that\nwe may keep her for a long, long time. She is everything she should be both as\nteacher and as a person. We have managed to do a little reading together and hope\nto do more, when she has her thesis and examination o\ufb00 her hands . . . \u201d (University\nof Chicago. Department of Mathematics. Records, Box 1, Folder 8, Special Col-\nlections Research Center, University of Chicago Library). Wiggin returned to the\nUniversity of Chicago and was in residence 1935\u201336 when she \ufb01nished her disserta-\ntion in the calculus of variations; she was awarded the PhD in 1936. She returned\nto Randolph-Macon and then was promoted to full professor in 1941.\n\nWiggin was on leave and was a lecturer at Wellesley College during 1942\u201343 and\ntaught at Emory University in summer 1949. In December of 1951 she attended a\ncomputing laboratory seminar at the Oak Ridge Institute of Nuclear Studies. In\nthe summer of 1953 she attended the \ufb01rst of the recently founded (1950) National\nScience Foundation\u2019s summer institutes in mathematics, this held at the University\nof Colorado for college teachers. The following summer she attended another NSF\ninstitute at the University of North Carolina. During 1954\u201355 she was on leave and\nstudied at the University of Chicago.\n\nOn June 20, 1956, Evelyn Wiggin married Sidney Casner, a retired lawyer, in\nChicago. Casner was born in 1890, grew up in Chicago, had degrees from the\nUniversity of Illinois and Kent College of Law, and attended the University of\nChicago Law School. He had practiced law and taught social sciences in Hyde Park\nHigh School in Chicago. He also had taught in the DePaul University College of Law\nand the Kent College of Law in Chicago. From July 1945 to August 1947, he was in\nEurope, where he served as a military judge and taught at army university centers in\nEngland, France, and Germany. According to a 1966 graduate of Randolph-Macon,\nSidney Casner had died by September 1962.\n\nAfter her marriage, Evelyn Wiggin Casner continued in her position at Randolph-\nMacon. For eight weeks during the summer of 1957, she was at Stanford on a grant\nfrom the Social Sciences Research Council studying applications of mathematics to\nthe social sciences. Based on this work she developed an experimental course for\nsocial science students at Randolph-Macon. During the late 1950s and early 1960s\nshe taught in seven NSF summer institutes for high school teachers.\n\nAlthough Casner was reportedly a very shy person, she held leadership positions\nin various organizations on campus and in Lynchburg. For example, she was presi-\ndent of the college faculty club and local chapters of Sigma Xi and AAUP. She was\nalso exceedingly active in the community. Soon after her arrival in Virginia, she was\npresident of the Lynchburg Consumer Cooperative 1932\u201340. She was involved with\nthe YWCA, and over many years served as president (1958\u201362), trail supervisor,\nand council member of the local Appalachian Trail Club. She was also a member\nof the Virginia Academy of Science.\n\nEvelyn Wiggin Casner died in Charlottesville, Virginia, at age sixty-four in 1964.\nThe Evelyn Casner Memorial Award was established by the Natural Bridge Ap-\npalachian Trail Club to be presented to the club member who logged the most miles\nduring a year on hikes scheduled by the club.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCASNER - 3\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, NCTM, AAAS, Sigma Delta Epsilon, AAUW,\nAAUP, Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nDissertation:\n1936 [Wiggin, E.

September 23, 1888\u2013February 19, 1971.\nWellesley College (BA 1911), Yale University (MA 1922, PhD 1925).\n\nEthel Louise Anderton was born in Dover, New Hampshire, the daughter of\nIsabelle (Richardson) (1853\u20131937) of New Hampshire and Washington Anderton\n(1854\u20131938) of England. Her father immigrated to the United States and went to\nDover as a fabric colorist to work in the Cocheco Manufacturing Company. Neither\nparent attended college, and they married in about 1880. Washington Anderton was\nsuperintendent of the print works from 1880 until his retirement in 1896, after which\nhe was in real estate. For at least a dozen years in the early decades of the century,\nIsabelle Anderton was proprietor of a stationery and variety store in Dover. Their\n\ufb01rst son, James, was born in 1882 and died as an infant. The surviving children\nwere Katherine Davis (b. 1885), Ethel, and Thomas R. (1895\u20131982). Katherine\nworked for the telephone company, and Thomas was an electrical engineer with\nWestinghouse.\n\nEthel Anderton graduated from Wellesley College in 1911, after which she taught\nin high schools until 1924. She was teaching in West\ufb01eld, Massachusetts, in at least\n1916 and 1917. The next year she began teaching in West Haven, Connecticut,\nand likely continued there until 1924. Also, starting in 1918, she attended Yale\nUniversity part time and earned her master\u2019s degree in 1922 and her doctorate in\n1925. She received university scholarships part of the time she was at Yale and was\nelected to Sigma Xi.\n\nAnderton became an instructor at Wellesley College in 1924 and remained for\nthree years, after which she taught one year, 1927\u201328, at Smith College. While at\nSmith she was promoted to assistant professor and continued in that rank when\nshe moved to Mount Holyoke College, where she remained for another three years.\nHer last college teaching job was in 1931\u201332, when she replaced a faculty member\non leave at Goucher College.\n\nIn 1933, at age forty-\ufb01ve, she rejoined the faculty at the high school in West\nHaven, Connecticut, as teacher and head of the mathematics department. While in\nWest Haven, she engaged in work on tests and measurements for the West Haven\nschool system and was active in various educational organizations. She was president\nof the West Haven Education Association and the West Haven Teachers\u2019 Credit\nUnion, and was a member of the Committee on Teacher Welfare of the National\nEducation Association. After her retirement in 1954, she engaged in a tutoring\nbusiness in college and high school mathematics. In her late seventies, she was still\ntutoring an average of three hours a day and went back to teach in high school for\nfour weeks as an emergency substitute.\n\nIn 1941 Anderton had a house built for herself in West Haven and was joined\nthere by Elsie Schenker, a teacher friend, and, a few years later, by Schenker\u2019s\nsister, both of whom lived with her for most of the rest of her life. Anderton\u2019s non-\nprofessional interests and activities included riding, gardening, and conservation;\nshe was a member of the League of Women Voters, the Connecticut Forest and\nPark Association, and was president of a local literary club.\n\nEthel Anderton died in New Haven, Connecticut, at age eighty-two in 1971.

April 6, 1902\u2013December 29, 1996.\nCornell University (BA 1924, MA 1928), University of Wisconsin (PhD 1937).\n\nCaroline Avery Lester was born in Seneca Falls, New York, the daughter of\nElizabeth (Campbell) (1868\u20131943), originally of Racine, Wisconsin, and Frederick\nWilliam Lester (1870\u20131947) of Seneca Falls. Her mother had attended a school for\nyoung ladies in New York City, and her father, a surgeon, had received his MD from\nColumbia University in 1894. Her parents married in 1897. Other children of the\nmarriage were Lora (1898\u20131984), a bacteriologist with a BA from William Smith\nCollege; John Campbell (1900\u20131984), a graduate of the US Naval Academy who\nretired as a rear admiral and then taught engineering at Penn State; and Agnes\n(1905\u20132000), who earned a BA from Cornell University in 1926.\n\nLester attended the First Ward School and the Mynderse Academy, public schools\nin Seneca Falls, from kindergarten until her high school graduation in 1920. Years\nlater, in 1985, she reported that her \ufb01rst motivation to pursue an education in\nmathematics came from a high school teacher, Miss Reamer, who had studied engi-\nneering at Cornell. Lester majored in mathematics at Cornell University, which she\nattended on a free tuition scholarship from New York State. In 1924, the year of her\ngraduation, she was elected to Pi Lambda Theta, a national honor and professional\nassociation in education, and to Phi Kappa Phi, a national honor society for all\ndisciplines. After her graduation she taught for three years in high schools in New\nYork State. During the summer of 1925 she studied education at Harvard Univer-\nsity. In 1927 she returned to Cornell and enrolled with an intended mathematics\nmajor and an education minor. At the end of the academic year she received her\nmaster\u2019s degree in mathematics.\n\nIn 1929 Lester went to the New York College for Teachers (now the State Uni-\nversity of New York at Albany) as an instructor and remained there except for\nsubsequent leaves. She continued her graduate work in mathematics at the Univer-\nsity of Chicago in the summers of 1933 and 1934 and was particularly motivated by\nA. A. Albert in algebra. Expecting to have a sabbatical leave for the year 1935\u201336,\nshe applied to return to Cornell. Although accepted by Cornell, Lester decided not\nto return there. Instead, she went to Ohio State University in the summer of 1935\nto work under C. C. MacDu\ufb00ee and then followed him to the University of Wis-\nconsin. She studied at Wisconsin the next two years while on leave from her job\nand completed her work for the PhD under MacDu\ufb00ee\u2019s direction in 1937 with a\nmajor in algebra and a minor in analysis. Lester traveled in Germany in the summer\nof 1937 and then returned to her position in Albany, where she was promoted to\nassistant professor by 1939 and to professor in 1950; she retired as emeritus profes-\nsor in 1967. While at SUNY Albany, she produced manuscripts on \u201cModern Views\nof Mathematics \u2013 Lectures on Groups, Rings and Fields\u201d and on the \u201cTheory of\nMatrices.\u201d\n\nLester was on leave from her position at Albany 1943\u201345, when she was a lieu-\ntenant in the United States Coast Guard (Women\u2019s Reserve). In a 1990 interview,\nLester described her entry into the military during World War II: \u201cI was invited to\njoin the WAVES, but was turned down because of the physical exam. So, I turned\nto the Coast Guard and was examined by a di\ufb00erent doctor and was found to be in\nperfect health.\u201d Commissioned in February 1943, she attended the US Coast Guard\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLESTER - 2\n\nAcademy for a three-week course and then was stationed at the Naval Communica-\ntions Annex in Washington, D.C., as a specialist in cryptanalysis from March 1943\nthrough September 1945. She reported in her 1990 interview that she \u201cdecoded\nmessages from Spain, Portugal and North Africa.\u201d\n\nIn May 1940 Lester was one of forty-three MAA members to petition for the\nformation of a section for upstate New York. Lester served as vice chairman of the\nUpper New York State Section, now called the Seaway Section, 1957\u201358 and as\nchairman 1958\u201359. She was the second woman to serve in these positions; Harriet\nMontague had been the \ufb01rst. From 1948 to 1951 Lester served as an associate editor\nof the American Mathematical Monthly.\n\nIn the early 1980s Lester moved to Indianapolis, Indiana, where her younger sister\nwas located. Lester was a member of the DAR, the National Society of Colonial\nDames of America, and the May\ufb02ower Society. She was a Republican and a member\nof a Presbyterian church and was especially interested in travel and bridge. Her\ntravels included at least four trips to Europe and two to Central America.

July 28, 1882\u2013January 2, 1977.\nRandolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College (BA 1903), University of Chicago (MS\n1911, PhD 1916).\n\nGillie Aldah Larew was born near Newbern, in Pulaski County, Virginia, the\ndaughter of Gillie Augusta (Glendy) (1846\u20131887) and Isaac Hall Larew (1840\u20131904),\nboth natives of Virginia. Her father had served as a captain in the Confederate\narmy during the Civil War. Her parents married on February 12, 1867. She had\nfour older siblings, John Glendy (1869\u20131876), Mary Alma Lyle (1872\u20131875), Cyrus\nGuy (1875\u20131908), and Robert Joseph (1877\u20131880), only one of whom was living at\nthe time of her birth; she also had a younger sister, Julia (b. 1884). Her father was\na farmer and a lawyer; he married a second time in about 1890 and had \ufb01ve more\nchildren. A later tribute indicated that she was \u201creared in a Christian home in an\natmosphere of liberal Presbyterianism\u201d and that \u201cthe place in the family\u2019s daily\nworship given to the great hymns of the Church and the Christian message\u201d was\nimportant to her (Lipscomb 1953, 34).\n\nGillie Larew received her primary and secondary education from private tutors\nbefore entering Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College in Lynchburg, Virginia, in Sep-\ntember 1899, near the end of the college\u2019s \ufb01rst decade. (The college was renamed\nRandolph College in July 2007 and became coeducational in September 2007.) Im-\nmediately after Larew\u2019s graduation in 1903 she became an instructor in mathemat-\nics there. She attended courses in the mathematics department at the University of\nChicago in the summers of 1906 and 1909 and in the spring and summer quarters\nof 1911. She wrote her master\u2019s thesis in mechanics to complete the work for her\nmaster\u2019s degree in 1911.\n\nLarew continued at Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College, except for leaves, for the\nremainder of her career. Having been made adjunct professor in 1909, she returned\nto the University of Chicago for seven quarters during the years 1914\u201316. She was a\nfellow in 1915\u201316, wrote her dissertation in the calculus of variations, and received\nher PhD in 1916. She returned to Randolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College and was\npromoted to associate professor in 1918 and to professor in 1921. She served as\nacting head of the department for a year in the early 1920s.\n\nApparently at the suggestion of G. A. Bliss, Larew\u2019s dissertation advisor, she\nspent the year 1929\u201330 in Munich studying mainly with Carath\u00b4eodory. In 1936 she\nbecame head of the department at Randolph-Macon and remained so until 1950,\nwhen that position went to M. Gweneth Humphreys, who had been hired from\nNewcomb College the year before, when Larew had become dean of the college.\nLarew became dean emeritus and professor emeritus upon her retirement in 1953,\nat age seventy. After her retirement she served on the college steering committee\nand helped with the alumnae development program. In 1952, shortly before her\nretirement, she presented her personal philosophy on the Edward R. Murrow radio\nprogram \u201cThis I believe.\u201d These views appeared the following year in an article,\n\u201cBut as for me. . . ,\u201d in the AAUW Journal. The article was described as: \u201cA fellow\nVirginian borrows Patrick Henry\u2019s famous words to introduce some thoughts on\nnonconformity\u201d (1954, 3).\n\nLarew was active in a number of professional organizations. In the 1920s she\nserved as secretary of the Mathematics Section of the Virginia Educational Con-\nference. After joining the MAA as a charter member, she attended many national\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLAREW - 2\n\nmeetings of the MAA and meetings of the Maryland-District of Columbia-Virginia\nSection, for which she was on the executive committee in the early 1930s and was\nchairman 1937\u201338; she served as regional governor from July 1945 to July 1947.\nLarew served on the research committee of the Virginia Academy of Science in the\nearly 1940s and was elected to the council in 1945. She was also very active in\nthe AAUW and served as president of the local branch in 1922 and president of\nthe state division 1938\u201340. The biographical notes to Larew\u2019s 1954 article say that\n\u201cher services to AAUW have been too numerous for listing here.

Two years\nseparated her from her older brother, Henry, and from her younger sister, Emily.\nHer father was a bank cashier.\n\nAfter graduating from Grinnell College in Iowa in 1923, Harshbarger was at\nWest Virginia University for the next two years, where she taught half time and\ndid graduate work in mathematics. She received her master\u2019s degree in 1925 and\nspent the next two years in Keyser, West Virginia, as head of the mathematics\ndepartment of Potomac State School, a junior college that was established as a\npreparatory school for West Virginia University in 1901.

      "text": "METCALF, Ida M. August 26, 1856\u2013October 24, 1952.\nBoston University (PhB 1886), Cornell University (MS 1889, PhD 1893).\n\nIda Martha Metcalf was born in Texas, the daughter of Martha C. (Williams) and\nCharles A. Metcalf. Her mother was born in 1823 in Vermont, and her father was\nborn in the early 1820s in Massachusetts. In 1850 Charles and Martha Metcalf were\nliving in Louisiana, where he was a bookkeeper. Ten years later, they and two girls,\nHelen E., age nine, and Ida M., age three, were living in New Orleans, where Charles\nwas a clerk. In 1952 Pearson Hunt of the Harvard Business School sent the Cornell\nUniversity alumni o\ufb03ce a short account of Ida Metcalf\u2019s life in which he reported\nthat she had come to Boston from Texas on a sailboat with her brother and mother\nsoon after her father died. In 1870 Martha Metcalf and two children, thirteen-\nyear-old Ida and nine-year-old Edward C., were living in Needham, Massachusetts,\nwith Martha\u2019s father and sisters. Hunt reported that while she was still in her\nteens, Metcalf taught in small schools in New Hampshire and worked in the \ufb01elds\nafter school. According to the 1880 census record, Ida Metcalf was then living in\nFramingham, Massachusetts, and was a student. It appears she was also a third\nassistant in the Hillside School in Jamaica Plain, Massachusetts, in the late 1870s\nand early 1880s while in her early to mid-twenties.\n\nMetcalf entered Boston University as a special student in 1883. After being listed\nby Boston University as a special student for two years, Metcalf was a regular\nstudent and received her PhB with the class of 1886. She wrote a thesis, \u201cThe\nOrigin and Development of Styles of Architecture.\u201d\n\nDuring the year 1888\u201389, Metcalf was a graduate student in mathematics at\nCornell University. She received her master\u2019s degree with a thesis, \u201cThe Theory of\nIllumination by Re\ufb02ected and Refracted Light.\u201d In February 1891, while teaching\nat the newly opened Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore, she inquired about returning\nto Cornell to work on a doctorate in mathematics.\n\nMetcalf spent the year 1892\u201393 at Cornell taking courses in geometry and anal-\nysis. At a meeting of the mathematical club in the spring of that year, Metcalf\npresented a paper on the work of the algebraic geometer Charlotte Scott of Bryn\nMawr College. Serving on her doctoral committee were department head James E.\nOliver and Lucien Augustus Wait, the other full professor in the department. Al-\nthough Oliver was chair of Metcalf\u2019s committee, she worked closely with George W.\nJones. In the preface to his Drill-Book in Algebra, Jones thanked her for spending\n\u201chalf a year in giving form to the text and preparing the questions and exercises\u201d\n(1892, iv). She also took a course in projective geometry, the area of her dissertation,\nwith him. Her doctorate was awarded magna cum laude in 1893.\n\nIn September 1897 a list of appointments to the three public high schools in\nNew York City (then Manhattan and the Bronx) showed Ida M. Metcalf of Boston\nhaving been appointed a second assistant for history at the Girls\u2019 High School. In the\n1900 census report Metcalf was listed with her mother and brother in Wellesley,\nMassachusetts, and was described as a teacher of mathematics; her brother was\na carpenter. In June 1900 the following advertisement appeared in the Atlantic\nMonthly Advertiser : \u201cNewton Lower Falls. Study by the Sea. Tutoring during July\nand August at a beautiful, restful, and inexpensive place on the coast of Maine.\nAddress Ida M. Metcalf, Ph.D., Newton L. Falls, Mass.\u201d (p. 20).\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMETCALF - 2\n\nIn 1902 an article critiquing an aspect of education in the United States appeared\nwith the author identi\ufb01ed only as Ida M. Metcalf, Bryn Mawr, Pennsylvania. In\nthe article, \u201cThe pampered children of the poor,\u201d (International Journal of Ethics\n13:87\u201398), the author writes, \u201cThe explicit statements in this essay are based on\npersonal experience in high-school teaching in a great city with a very large foreign\npopulation, and on the testimony of others engaged in the same work.\u201d\n\nMetcalf lived for a time in Newton Lower Falls, Massachusetts. She also worked\nfor a banking house in New York as a securities analyst. In 1909 she had printed\na nine-page pamphlet entitled \u201cA demonstration of Fermat\u2019s Theorem concerning\nthe equation xn + yn = zn.\u201d The error in her argument was pointed out in a 1910\nreview of the pamphlet in Archiv der Mathematik und Physik.\n\nIn April 1910 Metcalf was living in Brooklyn and was a teacher according to\nthe census. At about that time she passed a competitive examination for a civil\nservice position with the City of New York and left the teaching profession. Some\nof her later writing describes her pessimistic attitude toward education. In an article\nthat appeared in February 1911 she quoted actual answers to the New York State\nRegents\u2019 tests, uniform examinations given to high school students, in order to\ndocument \u201cthe degree of confusion, misconception, and inarticulateness that may,\nand often does, exist in the minds of some of our young people\u201d (In lighter vein:\nHumor in the regents\u2019 examinations, 640). The following year she wrote a letter to\nthe editor of the New York Times stating that \u201cthe real mission of the schools, the\ndevelopment of intellect and character, is not only shirked, but belittled\u201d (\u201cMaterial\naims of schools: Vocational training called a move in the wrong direction,\u201d July 17,\n1912).\n\nIn October 1910 Metcalf was appointed a monitor and in December 1910, at the\nage of \ufb01fty-three, she became a civil service examiner. Pearson Hunt reported that\nshe was the \ufb01rst woman to take such an examination, and was appointed despite\nher sex because of her performance. In 1912 she became a statistician for the De-\npartment of Finance for New York City. She attempted to take the examination for\nstatistician in the Education Department but was not permitted to do so based on\nher experience \u201cthough she had three college degrees, had taught public and private\nschool most of her life and had been statistician in the department of \ufb01nance over\ntwo years\u201d (Report of an Investigation of the Municipal Civil Service Commission,\n18). She remained in the Department of Finance until her retirement at the end\nof 1921. In 1930 she was living in Jamestown, Rhode Island. She worked again as\na civil service examiner on a per diem basis until 1939, when she was eighty-one\nyears old.\n\nDuring the time she was living in New York, Metcalf achieved some notoriety\nwhen she placed the following advertisement in the New York Times of October 17,\n1915:\n\nTo teachers and philanthropic workers:\nFree home and liberal education will be given little girl 8 or 9 years\nold with capacity to become a woman of high type if given oppor-\ntunities for development, but now lacking such opportunities.\n\nThe Times carried a story the next day concerning the advertisement. Metcalf took\na ward, eight-year-old Theresa Kalab, who was born in Austria. Kalab studied at\nNew York University and Columbia University and at the Grand Central School\nof Art and the Art Students League before becoming a commercial illustrator and\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMETCALF - 3\n\nauthor. At the time of Metcalf\u2019s death, Theresa Kalab was married to Lawrence\nSmith and living in Santa Fe, New Mexico.\n\nIn his 1952 letter, Pearson Hunt noted that \u201cIn view of her own hard struggles to\n\ufb01nd positions commensurate with her ability, Miss Metcalf throughout her life had\na very cynical view of higher education for women. Nevertheless, . . . Miss Metcalf\nmade a gift [to Cornell] which was earmarked for the assistance of women students.\u201d\nMetcalf also wrote letters to the editor of the New York Times indicating her\nfeminist beliefs. On January 25, 1914, the headline read \u201cThe rule of brute force\u201d\nand the letter following it critiqued an article by William T. Sedgwick, a professor\nof biology at MIT:\n\nProf. Sedgwick told us complacently . . . that if women persist in\nclaiming the same rights as other citizens men will exert their su-\nperior muscular force and reduce them to literal slavery. . . . Are\nwe to understand that all the men unable to hold their own against\na prize\ufb01ghter will be forcibly subdued and held in subjugation if\nthey ask for fair play and venture upon economic competition with\ntheir stronger fellow beings? Apparently the dictum of science, as\nexpressed by this prophet, is that we are evolving backward toward\nthe ancestor we share with the gorilla.\n\nOn October 11, 1922, Metcalf expressed her views on \u201cdiscrimination in business\ncircles against women of middle age, a condition the existence of which is readily\nadmitted by employers.\u201d She wrote\n\nThe thinking women of today of any age are asking for our sex not\nprivilege but \u201ca fair \ufb01eld and no favor,\u201d and intelligent employers, if\nthey would bring their business acumen and judgment to bear upon\nthe matter, would . . . seek the most competent and conscientious\nworker quite irrespective of such incidental qualities as age, sex,\ncomplexion, political a\ufb03liation or religious creed.\n\nBy 1931, Metcalf had moved to Jamestown, Rhode Island, where she had spent\nsummers for many years. In 1948 she became ill and moved to a nursing home in\nWashington, Connecticut, before moving to Fairlawn Nursing Home in Lexington,\nMassachusetts, where she lived just over a year before her death from arteriosclerosis\nat age ninety-six. She was buried in the Lincoln Cemetery in Lincoln, Massachusetts.\nThesis and dissertation:\n1886 The origin and development of styles of architecture.

November 16, 1907\u2013August 30, 1958.\nRadcliffe College (BA 1929, MA 1930, PhD 1932).\n\nMildred Marie Sullivan was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the youngest of two surviv-\ning children of three born to Alice T. (Sullivan) (b. 1875) and John F. Sullivan (b. 1871),\nboth born in Massachusetts of Irish parents. In 1900 her parents had been married six\nyears, and there was one living child, John F.

Her dissertation in potential theory was supervised\nby O. D. Kellogg. In Kellogg\u2019s November 1931 application for funds for a book project,\nhe wrote, \u201cthe assistant is available in Miss Mildred M. Sullivan, now a graduate student\nat Radcli\ufb00e and a candidate for the doctorate in June of the present year. She has un-\nusual originality and power to carry through, with a minimum of guidance, on assigned\nprograms. Her availability appears to present a rare opportunity for help on the above\nproject\u201d (Papers of William Fogg Osgood, HUG 4659.10, Harvard University Archives).\nSullivan planned to work as Kellogg\u2019s research assistant the year after she received her\ndoctorate in June. However, Kellogg died suddenly in July 1932. Sullivan was a research\nassistant in mathematics at Harvard under a Milton Fund grant in 1932\u201333. During that\nyear she presented their joint work at an AMS meeting and wrote a paper based on that\nwork that was published in 1935 under her name and Kellogg\u2019s in the Memoirs of the\nAmerican Academy of Arts and Sciences.\n\nThe year following her postdoctoral year at Harvard, Sullivan was a National Research\nFellow working at Rice Institute in Houston and at the University of California. She was\nan instructor at the University of Houston 1934\u201335, during its \ufb01rst year as a four-year\ninstitution. This was during the Great Depression, and there is no indication that Sullivan\nwas able to secure academic employment at the end of that year. In January 1937 Sullivan\nbecame an editorial assistant for the AMS in order to succeed Alta Odoms (Gray), who\nhad already resigned e\ufb00ective April 1, 1937. In 1938 Sullivan became an instructor at\nQueens College in Flushing, New York. She was an instructor until 1946, when she was\npromoted to assistant professor. The year after her promotion Sullivan joined the MAA\nand from then on regularly attended meetings of the Metropolitan New York Section. Also\nstarting when she became editorial assistant at the AMS in 1937, and continuing through\nthe 1940s, Sullivan attended several meetings a year of the society in the New York City\narea.\n\nMildred Sullivan died suddenly in August 1958 of heart failure at age \ufb01fty while visiting\nrelatives at her family\u2019s home in the Dorchester neighborhood of Boston, Massachusetts.\nShe is buried in Holyhood Cemetery in Brookline.\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1931(?)

Aline\nHuke\u2019s sister, Barbara Allen Huke, was born in Massachusetts in 1905, earned a BS\ndegree from Massachusetts Agricultural College (now University of Massachusetts\nat Amherst), and died in 1927 while a graduate student in microbiology at Yale.\nIn 1920, Aline Huke, her mother, and her sister were living in South Hadley Falls,\nMassachusetts, with her maternal grandmother and her aunt. Her mother was a\npublic school teacher there.\n\nHuke received her elementary and secondary education in the public schools of\nSouth Hadley, Massachusetts, and attended the high school there 1916\u201320. She\nwrote in 1982 that she \u201c\ufb01rst really liked mathematics when [she] studied plane\ngeometry in high school\u201d (Smithsonian questionnaire). At Mount Holyoke College\nshe took thirteen courses in mathematics, eight in German, six in physics, and four\nin music. She earned sophomore honors and was elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her\njunior year. During the summer of 1923, she studied education at Columbia before\ncompleting her work at Mount Holyoke and graduating magna cum laude in 1924.\nAfter her graduation from Mount Holyoke, Huke taught physics and algebra at the\nhigh school in Cobleskill, New York, for two years. In the summer of 1926 she took\ncourses in pedagogy at the New York College for Teachers in Albany (now SUNY\nat Albany).\n\nAline Huke began her graduate work at the University of Chicago in October\n1926 and remained through August 1927, when she completed her work for a mas-\nter\u2019s degree with a thesis in mathematical physics, directed by A. C. Lunn of the\nmathematics department. During the year 1927\u201328, she held a resident fellowship\nin mathematics at Bryn Mawr College, where she studied with D. V. Widder and\nEcho D. Pepper. Huke returned to Chicago in the fall quarter of 1928 and held\na graduate service scholarship for four consecutive quarters. She left Chicago to\ntake a position as instructor of mathematics at Mount Holyoke College for the year\n1929\u201330. She completed her dissertation in the calculus of variations and received\nher PhD from Chicago in 1930.\n\nIn 1930 Aline Huke went to Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State\nUniversity) as an instructor of mathematics. On June 3 of the following year she\nmarried Orrin Frink, Jr., who had joined the mathematics faculty at Penn State\nin 1928. Frink, born May 31, 1901, in Brooklyn, New York, had earned his BA\nin 1922, MA in 1923, and PhD in 1926, all from Columbia University. He was an\ninstructor at Princeton 1925\u201326 and a National Research Council fellow at Chicago\n1926\u201327 and at Princeton 1927\u201328. Except for short periods on leave, Orrin Frink\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nFRINK - 2\n\nremained at Penn State for the rest of his career. He was assistant professor 1928\u2013\n29, associate professor 1929\u201333, and professor 1933\u201369. He was at the Institute for\nAdvanced Study in 1940\u201341 and later was head of the department at Penn State\nfor just over a decade.\n\nAline Frink gave up her full-time position for several years after her marriage in\n1931. Orrin III, the \ufb01rst of their four children, was born in 1932. The other children\nwere: Peter Hill, born 1939; John Allen, born 1941; and Elizabeth, born 1945. Aline\nFrink published mathematics papers in 1937 and 1938 and taught as an instructor\nat Penn State part time 1936\u201337 and occasionally, some part time and some full\ntime, through 1944. She reported in a letter to one of the authors in 1977 that\nit was because of the e\ufb00orts of Helen B. Owens that she was able to continue to\nteach after her marriage; Owens\u2019s husband, F. O. Owens, was the chairman of the\nPenn State mathematics department. Aline Frink wrote that she had somewhat\nannoyed him \u201cby becoming pregnant and giving up the position that he had gotten\nfor me somewhat in opposition to the administration.\u201d She also noted that Helen\nOwens \u201cwas thwarted by discrimination against women and determined that the\nsame attitudes should not be held toward women in the future.\u201d\n\nAll but one of the children graduated from Pennsylvania State University. Orrin\nFrink III graduated from Haverford College and earned a PhD in Slavic languages\nand literature from Harvard before pursuing a career as a professor of foreign lan-\nguages and literature; his last position was at Iowa State University. Peter H. Frink\nreceived an MFA degree from Yale and became an architect in Philadelphia. John\nA. Frink, became a computer analyst in Wilmington, Delaware, after having grad-\nuated with a mathematics major. Elizabeth Frink received an MFA degree from\nthe University of North Carolina at Greensboro and studied at the Slade School of\nArt in London. She lives in Kennebunkport, Maine.\n\nIn 1947 Aline Frink resumed her career as a full-time faculty member. She was\nassistant professor until 1952, associate professor until 1962, and professor until her\nretirement in 1969, after which she was professor emeritus. Orrin Frink was head\nof the department from 1949 until 1960. In 1977 Aline Frink wrote that \u201cneedless\nto say, I wasn\u2019t appointed a full professor during that time.\u201d While at Penn State,\nshe directed several master\u2019s theses; she published her last research paper in 1960.\nOrrin Frink was an assistant chief engineer at the Special Projects Laboratory at\nWright Patterson Air Force Base 1944\u201345. He was a Fulbright lecturer in Dublin,\nIreland, 1960\u201361 and 1965\u201366. During the latter visit, Aline Frink lectured for a\nmonth at University College, Dublin, after she was asked to \ufb01ll in for the analysis\nlecturer who was ill.\n\nHaving long had an interest in languages, Aline Frink began to study Russian\nin the late 1940s. This, together with her mathematical expertise in the calculus\nof variations, resulted in the book translation listed as 1962 below. She began the\nstudy of Chinese shortly before her retirement.\n\nAfter the Frinks retired in 1969, they moved to a house in Kennebunkport, Maine,\nthat had been in Aline Huke Frink\u2019s family since 1747. Her obituary indicates that\nshe was a lifelong summer resident there. Orrin Frink died on March 4, 1988. Aline\nFrink was a member of the Congregational church, was treasurer of the Olympian\nClub of Kennebunkport and was vice president of the Kennebunkport Historical\nSociety. She had a strong interest in music, bird watching, and her grandchildren.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nFRINK - 3\n\nAline H. Frink died at the Kennebunk Nursing Center in Kennebunk, Maine,\nin 2000. She was ninety-six. Her obituary notes that she \u201cstayed independent and\nstrong-willed, driving and living alone\u201d until about a year before her death. She\nwas survived by her four children and eight grandchildren.

      "text": "REKLIS, Virginia (Modesitt). June 15, 1910\u2013November 29, 2000.\nMount Holyoke College (BA 1931), University of Illinois (MA 1932, PhD\n1937).\n\nVirginia Modesitt was born in Bloomington, Indiana, the only child of Floy\n(Underwood) (1885\u20131984) and Raymond Lyons Modesitt (1883\u20131927). Both of her\nparents were natives of central Indiana; her mother was born in Putnam County\nand her father in neighboring Parke County. Both received bachelor\u2019s degrees from\nIndiana University in 1908; her father also earned a master\u2019s degree from Indiana\nthe following year. They were married on August 17, 1909, and Virginia Modesitt\nwas born the following June. The 1910 census lists her father as a high school\nteacher in Bloomington.\n\nRaymond Modesitt became a teacher of mathematics at Eastern Illinois State\nNormal School, in Charleston (later Eastern Illinois State Teachers College, now\nEastern Illinois University). He did additional graduate work in mathematics at\nColumbia University in 1911 and at the University of Illinois in 1921. In 1913\nR. L. Modesitt served as chairman of a committee of the mathematics section of\nthe University of Illinois High-School Conference that studied the establishment\nof standards for high-school algebra; he later wrote an article for the Mathematics\nTeacher on fundamental principles of algebra (15 (1922): 332\u201346). Virginia Modesitt\ngraduated from Eastern Illinois State Teachers College High School in 1927. Her\nfather died suddenly in December of that year, and she remained in Charleston and\nattended the teachers college for a year before entering Mount Holyoke College in\nSeptember 1928. She had a major in mathematics and a minor in astronomy at\nMount Holyoke. She did honors work with Marie Litzinger, who had not yet earned\nher doctorate, and all of her mathematics course work there was with Litzinger\nand Emilie Norton Martin. Modesitt attended Butler University in Indianapolis,\nIndiana, in the summer of 1930 and graduated from Mount Holyoke magna cum\nlaude in 1931. She also tutored during her senior year at Mount Holyoke.\n\nIn the fall of 1931 Modesitt entered the University of Illinois for graduate work.\nShe received her master\u2019s degree the following year and stayed at Illinois until she\nreceived her doctorate in 1937 with a minor in astronomy. Her dissertation in dif-\nferential geometry was directed by Harry Levy. In addition to her course work with\nLevy, she later recalled and mentioned courses with R. D. Carmichael, A. B. Coble,\nand A. R. Crathorne. She read history of mathematics with G. A. Miller and took\nhigher algebra with Olive C. Hazlett. While at Illinois she was a secretary in the\nastronomy department 1933\u201334 and was an assistant in the mathematics depart-\nment 1934\u201337. In 1934 she published an article with a fellow graduate student, Ted\nMartin (later chair of the mathematics department at MIT), in the Astrophysical\nJournal.\n\nAfter receiving her degree in 1937, Modesitt took a temporary instructorship at\nRandolph-Macon Woman\u2019s College in Virginia to substitute for someone on leave\nof absence. Modesitt took more mathematics courses at the University of Michigan\nduring the summer of 1938. The position at Randolph-Macon was extended one\nmore year, but no position was available there in the fall of 1939 even though she\nhad enthusiastic support from Gillie Larew, the mathematics department chair at\nRandolph-Macon.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nREKLIS - 2\n\nIn 1939 Modesitt moved to Chicago, where she was an instructor at Wright\nJunior College for the next four years. She had learned of the job there through\nRuth Mason Ballard, with whom Modesitt had shared an o\ufb03ce during 1936\u201337,\nModesitt\u2019s last year at Illinois. Ruth Mason had been an instructor at Illinois before\nmoving to Wright Junior College in 1938. At Wright they worked together on the\ndevelopment of survey courses for junior colleges, and both remained there until\n1943, when Wright was taken over by the Navy as barracks and all the junior colleges\nin the city were combined into one. While in Chicago Modesitt was a member of\nthe Women\u2019s Math Club and presented a paper at one of the meetings.\n\nOn January 20, 1942, Virginia Modesitt married Ernest Peter Reklis, whom she\nhad met while both were students at the University of Illinois. Ernest Reklis, born\nin Cicero, Illinois, in 1912, was an engineer who worked at Commonwealth Edison\nin Chicago after receiving his BS in engineering from Illinois in 1939. He was in\nthe army from 1943 to 1945; they moved to the East, where both worked at the\nAberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland. Virginia Reklis was \ufb01rst a \u201ccomputer\u201d\nand then a mathematician at the Ballistic Research Laboratories, Army Service\nForces, 1944\u201347. After the war Ernest Reklis remained at the Ballistic Research\nLaboratories at the Aberdeen Proving Ground as an engineer working on supersonic\nwind tunnels.\n\nTheir son, Robert Peter Reklis, was born in September 1947. He subsequently\nearned a PhD in physics and is a research scientist in California. Virginia Reklis\ndid not seek employment while their son was young. However, she later was an\ninstructor of extension courses: for the University of Maryland at the Edgewood\nArsenal in Maryland 1960\u201365, and for the University of Delaware at the Aberdeen\nProving Ground 1962\u201366.\n\nIn her 1985 Smithsonian questionnaire, Virginia Reklis noted that she was brought\nup in an academic community and that her father was an outstanding teacher of\nmathematics. She described her religious preference as Presbyterian. She was a\nmember of the Daughters of the American Revolution and the P.E.O. Sisterhood, a\nphilanthropic educational organization. Beginning in 1967, Reklis published several\ngenealogies, some of which were coauthored with Helen Kurtz Wray. Virginia Rek-\nlis\u2019s husband died at age sixty-two in 1975; her mother died at ninety-nine in 1984.\nIn the middle 1980s Virginia Reklis lived in her mother\u2019s former home in Danville,\nIndiana. She later moved to California, closer to her son\u2019s family.\n\nVirginia Reklis died at Palo Alto Commons, an assisted living facility in Palo\nAlto, California, in November 2000 at age ninety. She was survived by her son,\nthree grandchildren, and two great-grandchildren.

Her parents were born in the\nPortland, Oregon, area: her father in Oregon City and her mother in Portland;\nthey married in 1903. Her mother attended high school in Portland and later was\na teacher and a housewife. Her father had an LLB degree from the University of\nOregon and was an attorney. Andrewa Noble and her siblings were born in Oregon\nCity and all attended college. The eldest, Louise (1906\u20131995), was a teacher and\nhousewife; John Wesley (1913\u20131975) was a newspaperman and professional writer;\nand Inez (1916\u20131994) was a stenographer and housewife and served in the Women\u2019s\nArmy Corps in World War II.\n\nAndrewa Noble attended public elementary school 1913\u201321 and high school 1921\u2013\n25 in Oregon City. At graduation she received an honor scholarship to Paci\ufb01c Uni-\nversity in Forest Grove, Oregon. Four years later she graduated from Paci\ufb01c magna\ncum laude. While at Paci\ufb01c, she was involved with the drama club; was a member\nof the Women\u2019s Athletic Association; and played soccer, basketball, and volley-\nball. She was a member of Alpha Kappa Delta, a local sorority, and worked on the\nuniversity\u2019s yearbook. She was active in the debate club and earned the Witham\ndebate cup her junior year. In her senior year she was the vice president of ASPU,\nthe student association, and was editor of The Index, the college newspaper. She\nserved as the permanent secretary of her graduating class of 1929. The year follow-\ning her graduation she was vice president of the alumni council and was living in\nGladstone, Oregon.\n\nIn 1930 Noble became a high school teacher in Tosten, Montana, and taught\nthere until 1932. She was a graduate student at the University of California 1933\u2013\n35. While in Berkeley she earned a master\u2019s degree in 1934 and a doctorate in 1935.\nShe studied, among other subjects, logic with A. B. Bernstein, projective di\ufb00eren-\ntial geometry with Pauline Sperry, and number theory with D. N. Lehmer, who\ndirected her dissertation in that area. She became a life member of the University\nof California\u2019s alumni association.\n\nDuring 1935\u201336 Noble was a teacher in Colstrip, Montana, and the following\nyear she was superintendent of schools there.

In 1940 Noble became an instructor at San Francisco\nJunior College and stayed in that position until 1945, serving as coordinator of the\nremedial arithmetic program from 1942. She was appointed instructor at Montana\nState University (now University of Montana) in Missoula sometime before July\n1946 and spent the academic year 1946\u201347 as an assistant professor there.\n\nIn 1947 Noble returned to her alma mater, Paci\ufb01c University, and was an as-\nsociate professor and secretary of the faculty for two years. It appears she then\nlived with her brother in Oakland, California, for some time before joining the fac-\nulty at Mills College in 1952. From 1952 until 1957 she was assistant professor of\nmathematics and physics and head of the department at Mills, a women\u2019s college\nin Oakland. From 1957 to 1959 she was assistant professor at Chico State College\nbefore returning to Paci\ufb01c University, where she was to teach the last eight years\nof her career.

      "text": "MARTIN, Emilie Norton. December 30, 1869\u2013February 8, 1936.\nBryn Mawr College (BA 1894, PhD 1901).\n\nEmilie Norton Martin was born in Elizabeth, New Jersey, the eldest of three\nsurviving children of Mary Holmes (Ford) (b. 1838) and Robert Wilkie Martin\n(b. 1841) of Pennsylvania. Her parents married in 1868, and her siblings were a\nsister, Mary Ford (b. 1871), and a brother, Collier Ford (1873\u20131941). Her father\nwas a surgeon, and her brother became a physician and professor of medicine in\nPhiladelphia.\n\nMartin was prepared for college at Mrs. E. L. Head\u2019s School in Germantown,\nPhiladelphia, and by private study. She entered Bryn Mawr College in 1890 and\nremained a student a\ufb03liated with the college for most of the decade. Her major\nareas of study as an undergraduate were Latin and mathematics. Immediately after\nshe earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1894, she began graduate studies there.\n\nMartin was a graduate student in mathematics and physics during the \ufb01rst se-\nmester 1894\u201395 and was a teacher of Latin in the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore\nduring the second semester of that year. She resumed her studies as a fellow in\nmathematics 1895\u201396 and continued as a graduate student 1896\u201397. The Mathe-\nmatics Journal Club at Bryn Mawr began in the fall of 1896, and records show\nthat Martin, who spoke on a topic in group theory, was one of four graduate stu-\ndents who gave presentations that year. The other speakers were Charlotte A. Scott\nand James Harkness, the Bryn Mawr mathematics faculty members; Frank Morley\nand E. W. Brown, mathematics faculty from nearby Haverford College; and Isabel\nMaddison, an 1896 Bryn Mawr PhD recipient who was a reader in mathematics.\n\nCharlotte Scott, in a letter of March 19, 1897, to Felix Klein, wrote, \u201cI am expect-\ning to send two of my best students to G\u00a8ottingen next year; to both of them have\nbeen awarded College Fellowships, . . . . One of them you met when you were here\nthat Sunday afternoon\u201d (Klein Nachlass, XI, Briefe an Klein, Universit\u00a8atsarchiv\nG\u00a8ottingen). One was Emilie Martin, as a holder of the Mary E. Garrett European\nfellowship; other Bryn Mawr students in G\u00a8ottingen during the year 1897\u201398 were\nVirginia Ragsdale and Fanny Gates. All were in Klein\u2019s course in Mechanik during\nthe winter semester, and Martin and Ragsdale were in the course in the summer\nsemester of 1897\u201398. Ragsdale also studied with David Hilbert at G\u00a8ottingen.\n\nMartin returned to Bryn Mawr as a fellow by courtesy in mathematics for the\nyear 1898\u201399. According to the description of her life given in her dissertation,\nshe studied mathematics with Charlotte Scott and James Harkness, passed her\ndoctoral examination in the spring of 1899, with a \u201cdouble minor\u201d in physics, which\nshe studied under Arthur Stanley Mackenzie. Although her name and dissertation\ntitle appear in the 1899 commencement program and on the 1899 list in Science\nof doctorates conferred, her PhD was dated 1901, the year her dissertation was\npublished. The published version, which bears a slightly di\ufb00erent title than the title\nthat appeared in 1899, was mentioned in G. A. Miller\u2019s second and third reports\non progress in \ufb01nite group theory published in the Bulletin of the AMS in 1902\nand 1907, respectively. Her dissertation was written under the direction of James\nHarkness; nonetheless, Harkness does not seem to have been the faculty member\nby whom she felt most in\ufb02uenced. Martin later endowed a mathematical book fund\ninspiration given during her study under\nat Bryn Mawr \u201cin appreciation of . . .\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMARTIN - 2\n\nthe guidance of Professor Charlotte Angas Scott\u201d (Bryn Mawr College Library,\nMathematical Book Fund).\n\nEmilie Martin\u2019s \ufb01rst position after leaving Bryn Mawr in 1899 was as a teacher\nof mathematics in the Misses Kirk\u2019s School, Rosemont, Pennsylvania, during 1899\u2013\n1900. She was also a collaborator for the Revue semestrielle des publications math\u00b4e-\nmatiques during the years 1899\u20131902. Martin did postgraduate work at Bryn Mawr\nin 1901\u201302, when her name again appears on the list of those giving talks in the\njournal club. She was also a private tutor of mathematics and Latin 1893\u20131903.\n\nMartin took a position as instructor at Mount Holyoke College in 1903. She was\nan instructor there 1903\u201304 and \ufb01rst semester 1904\u201305. She had a leave of absence\nfor the second semester of 1904\u201305. During this period she compiled the general\nindex for the years 1891\u20131904 of the Bulletin of the AMS. Martin returned to Bryn\nMawr for postdoctoral study in 1906\u201307 and again participated in the journal club.\nHer presentations were on methods of representing functions of a complex variable\nand on Klein\u2019s new kind of Riemann surface.\n\nIn 1907 Martin returned to Mount Holyoke College as instructor. She remained\nat that rank until 1911, when she was promoted to associate professor. She was\npromoted to professor in 1925 and became professor emeritus after her resignation\nin September 1935. She was also department chairman from 1927 through 1935.\n\nMartin described herself as a Presbyterian in 1914 and later was said to have\nmaintained an interest in religious issues. Also in 1914, she listed herself as a member\nof the American Geographical Society and the College Club of Philadelphia. In\naddition to her work as a mathematics professor, she was a resident faculty member\nof Pearsons Hall, where she lived during the greater part of her career at Mount\nHolyoke. She also was secretary of the Mount Holyoke branch of the AAUP. She\ntraveled in Europe in the summer of 1926. For many years she spent summers with\nher sister in Montreat, North Carolina.\n\nIn 1934 Emilie Martin was diagnosed with cancer and underwent surgery in June\nof that year. She resigned her position in September 1935 and died in February\n1936 at age sixty-six in her apartment in Hooker House on the Mount Holyoke\ncampus. One of Martin\u2019s closest friends, Frances Haynes, assistant librarian at\nMount Holyoke, accompanied her body to Philadelphia, where she was buried.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA (charter member), AAAS, AAUP.\n\nDissertation:\n1899 Determination of the non-primitive substitution groups of degree \ufb01fteen and of the\nprimitive substitution groups of degree eighteen.

February 21, 1881\u2013October 15, 1966.\nVassar College (BA 1904, MA 1905), Columbia University (PhD 1922).\n\nEugenie Maria Morenus was born in Cleveland, New York, the \ufb01rst of two chil-\ndren of Maria Euphemia (Van Blarcorn) (1855\u20131924) and Eugene Morenus (1854\u2013\n1929), both natives of New York. In the 1900 census her father was described as\nmanager of a glass works in Cleveland, New York, and later as a manufacturer of\nthermometers. Her brother, Jeremiah B. (1884\u20131969), was also born in New York\nState.\n\nIn 1900, when she was nineteen, Morenus was a boarder in East Washington,\nPennsylvania, while attending school. After receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree from\nVassar College in 1904, she remained there on a Coykendall scholarship for the year\n1904\u201305, wrote a thesis in algebraic geometry, and received a master\u2019s degree in\n1905. From January 1906 until June 1907 Morenus was a teacher of mathematics\nand Latin at Watertown (New York) High School. She was a substitute in mathe-\nmatics at Vassar 1907\u201308 and was a teacher of mathematics at Poughkeepsie High\nSchool 1908\u201309.\n\nIn 1909, at the age of twenty-eight, Morenus began her long association with\nSweet Briar College, about a dozen miles from Lynchburg, Virginia. This college\nfor women had just begun to o\ufb00er instruction at the postsecondary level three years\nbefore she arrived. She was instructor in mathematics and Latin 1909\u201316, associate\nprofessor of mathematics 1916\u201318, and then professor of mathematics. She was on\nleave 1918\u201319 and returned as head of the department, a position in which she\ncontinued until her retirement in 1946. Among those hired by Sweet Briar while\nMorenus was head of the department were Helen Calkins 1927\u201328, who was acting\nhead while Morenus was on leave; Julia Wells Bower 1927\u201330; Ethel Moody 1930\u2013\n33; and Nancy Cole 1933\u201343, who served as acting head 1934\u201335 and 1941\u201342.\n\nAfter Morenus went to Sweet Briar she continued her studies at the University\nof Chicago in the summer of 1912 and at G\u00a8ottingen in the summer of 1913. She\nstudied at Columbia University in the summers of 1915 and 1916 and held an\nalumnae fellowship from Vassar for study at Columbia 1918\u201319. She studied at\nColumbia again during the summers of 1920 and 1921 and received her PhD from\nColumbia in 1922. Although she wanted to \ufb01nd a position at an institution that\nsupported research, Morenus returned to Sweet Briar and attempted to continue\nher work in di\ufb00erential geometry. In May 1923 she passed, cum laude, the \ufb01rst part\nof the associate examination of the American Society of Actuaries.\n\nMorenus often attended meetings of the AMS, and she attended the International\nMathematical Congress in Toronto in 1924 and in Oslo in 1936. She spent the year\n1927\u201328 as an AAUW Anna C. Brackett memorial fellow in Cambridge, England. In\nthe summer of 1930 she did additional work at the University of Chicago. Morenus\nhad leaves in 1934\u201335, when she took an extensive trip that included India, and in\n1941\u201342, when she spent part of the year in Berkeley, California. She later reported\nhaving studied at the University of California.\n\nAt Sweet Briar she was known for the excellence of her scholarship and her\nhigh standards. She was active within the college, where for many years she was\nsecretary of the faculty and was chairman of the committee on instruction. The\nSweet Briar memorial tribute by two colleagues, Gladys Boone and Bertha Wailes,\nat the college also conveys a sense of her non-scholarly interests.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMORENUS - 2\n\nOne of her earliest outside activities at Sweet Briar was to enroll in\na cookery class o\ufb00ered in the domestic science department which\nthen existed. She sang in the choir, was considered an excellent pho-\ntographer and furnished numerous pictures for the early yearbooks.\nShe was also interested in athletics, and at times is said to have\nhelped President Benedict keep an eye on swimmers in the lake.\nHowever, riding was her chief joy, and she and her horse, October,\na\ufb00ectionately known as Toby, were familiar sights in the country-\nside as well as on college campus. She rode almost daily, and on\noccasion took students on overnight horseback trips to Peaks of\nOtter, Natural Bridge, into the mountains to Hog Camp, and to\nother distant places otherwise out-of-bounds to student riders.\n\nDramatics was another of Gene\u2019s loves. She planned and di-\nrected faculty plays which were an annual event in those days,\nstarring in a number of them herself, . . . . During her sojourn in\nLynchburg its Little Theatre also bene\ufb01ted from her talents. (Sweet\nBriar College Archives)\n\nMorenus engaged in a number of professional activities. She was a charter mem-\nber of the MAA, was a member of the Virginia Academy of Science, and was active\nin the AAUW. For the latter she served as president of the Sweet Briar branch and\nas chairman of the education committee of the Virginia division at various times.\nDuring World War I, in response to calls for volunteers to help sta\ufb00 factories, she\nworked for six weeks one summer at an overall factory in Lynchburg. Her family\nowned a candle factory in her hometown, which required some attention on her\npart. It was later sold, and Morenus made bequests to Vassar and to Sweet Briar.\nIn about 1940 Morenus described herself as an Episcopalian and a Republican. She\nwas a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution. She made other trips\nabroad in addition to her trips to study in G\u00a8ottingen and Cambridge and her trip\nduring her leave of 1934\u201335. These included a trip to Europe in summer 1936, a\ncruise in February 1950, and a European trip in 1955.\n\nAfter her retirement from Sweet Briar in 1946, Morenus changed her address in\nAMS membership lists from Sweet Briar to her family home in Cleveland, New York,\nnortheast of Syracuse. She taught at Connecticut College in 1947, and for some\ntime after that she spent her summers in Cleveland and her winters in Lynchburg.\nSometime later she moved to Babson Park, Florida. She was in a hospital in Lake\nWales, Florida, most of the last three years of her life.\n\nEugenie Morenus died in 1966 in Lake Wales at age eighty-\ufb01ve. She was cremated,\nand her ashes were sent back to her home town of Cleveland, New York, where her\nbrother was living. In 1960 the Eugenie M.

      "text": "MERRILL, Winifred (Edgerton). September 24, 1862\u2013September 6, 1951.\nWellesley College (BA 1883), Columbia College (PhD 1886).\n\nWinifred Haring Edgerton was born in Ripon, Wisconsin, the daughter of Clara\n(Cooper) and Emmet Edgerton. Both of her parents were born in about 1830, her\nmother in Vermont and her father in New York State. At the time of the 1860\ncensus, her parents and eight-year-old Eber Edgerton born in New York were living\nwith her mother\u2019s parents in Ripon. Both her father and her maternal grandfather\nwere listed as farmers. It appears that a few years after her birth, Winifred\u2019s family\nmoved to New York City, where her father was a real estate operator.\n\nWinifred Edgerton received her precollege education from private tutors and\ngraduated from Wellesley in 1883. She received a strong mathematics education at\nWellesley. While she was there the mathematics faculty consisted of Helen Schafer\nand Ellen Hayes, both Oberlin graduates; Eva Chandler, a University of Michigan\ngraduate; and Sophia B. Horr, teacher of mathematics and drawing. The mathe-\nmatics electives at that time included analytic geometry, di\ufb00erential and integral\ncalculus, analytical mechanics, and mathematical astronomy.\n\nAfter her graduation, Edgerton moved back to New York City and lived with\nher parents, who supported her decision to continue her study of mathematics and\nastronomy at Columbia College, which o\ufb00ered graduate degrees in pure science until\nthe formation of Columbia University in 1896. Although the college had not awarded\ndegrees to women, Edgerton had the backing of Columbia\u2019s president, Frederick A.\nP. Barnard, a strong supporter of the admission of women to Columbia College.\nShe had met Barnard through Melvil Dewey, who had been librarian at Wellesley\nand had become the head of the library at Columbia.\n\nDuring 1883 Edgerton did independent work in mathematical astronomy, and\nin January 1884 she applied to Columbia to pursue her studies in the observatory\nunder the direction of John K. Rees, one of the charter members of the AMS.\nThe Reverend Morgan Dix, rector of Trinity Church, who in 1883 had led the\nopposition of the Columbia College trustees to a move to coeducation, apparently\nwas convinced that she should be given the opportunity to work in the observatory.\nDix kept a diary that included his views on coeducation and Edgerton\u2019s admission\nto Columbia; a transcription of those entries is preserved in the Winifred Edgerton\nMerrill \ufb01le in the Columbiana collection. On January 18, 1884, he wrote, \u201cthe\nprincipal thing [the Committee on the Course and Statutes of Columbia College]\ndid was to admit Miss Winifred H. Edgerton to the observatory. . . ; the case was\nof an absolutely exceptional nature, and established no precedent for others.\u201d Two\nyears later, on February 1, 1886, Dix noted that \u201cI introduced a resolution in\nfavour of allowing Miss Edgerton to present herself for examination for the degree\nof Doctor of Philosophy, and moved its reference to the Committee on the Collegiate\nEducation of Women.\u201d In June he \u201cmoved that Winifred Edgerton have the degree\nof Ph.D., cum laude, which was unanimously agreed to. She fully deserves it.\u201d\n\nEdgerton\u2019s admission to Columbia was speci\ufb01cally to allow her access to the\nastronomical instruments and not as a student per se. In a 1933 speech, Virginia C.\nGildersleeve, then dean of Barnard College, quoted several passages from minutes\nof the trustees concerning Edgerton\u2019s admission to Columbia and the granting of\nher degree. The February 4, 1884, minutes of the trustees show that they gave her\n\u201caccess to the Observatory and the use of its instruments, placing her under the\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMERRILL, W. E. - 2\n\ndirection of adjunct professor Rees, with the understanding that she will render,\nfrom time to time, such assistance in the practical work of the Observatory as may\nbe in her power,\u201d and the June 7, 1886, minutes indicate that she had pursued a\n\u201ccourse in Practical Astronomy and Pure Mathematics in the Graduate Depart-\nment\u201d (Winifred Edgerton Merrill \ufb01le). In 1982 Edgerton\u2019s son, Hamilton Merrill,\nreported that she had told him \u201cthat a condition of her admission was to dust\nthe astronomical inst[rument]s and so comport herself as not to disturb the men\nstudents.\u201d\n\nWhile working in the observatory, Edgerton also taught at Mrs. Sylvanus Reed\u2019s\nBoarding and Day School for Young Ladies. Caroline Gallop Reed had opened her\nschool in 1864 and by 1878 it had a collegiate department that was incorporated as\na college in 1883. In a 1944 interview with Winifred Edgerton Merrill by Columbia\nUniversity librarian Roger Howson, Howson noted and Merrill con\ufb01rmed that \u201cthere\nwas some talk of taking in Mrs. Reed\u2019s school as part of Columbia\u201d (Winifred\nEdgerton Merrill \ufb01le). Although this did not happen, with Edgerton as a chaperon\nthe young women from that school were permitted to sit in on lectures at Columbia.\nAlso teaching at Mrs. Reed\u2019s school at this time was a future Columbia president,\nNicholas Murray Butler.\n\nEdgerton also attended at least one class in geology from Johns S. Newberry, who\ngave her a microscope to use in her classes at Mrs. Reed\u2019s school. Her mathematics\ninstructors were William Guy Peck and J. H. Van Amringe. Although she later\nreported writing two dissertations, one in mathematics and one in astronomy, her\ndegree was awarded on the basis of a dissertation in mathematics. In his report to\nthe president of Columbia in May 1886, Van Amringe paraphrased the prefatory\nnote to the dissertation by saying that \u201cit exhibits originality of treatment in the\nplan of unifying the di\ufb00erent systems of analytical geometry, . . . , the application of\nquaternions as a reference system for multiple integrals by means of the equations\nof transformation, . . . , and the reduction of the equations of transformation to the\nsimple formula, \u03c1 = rktjskj\u2212sk\u2212t\u201d (pp. 79\u201380).\n\nIn 1886 Winifred Edgerton became the \ufb01rst woman to receive a degree from\nColumbia and the \ufb01rst American woman to receive a PhD in mathematics. Her\ndegree is often listed as being in astronomy although the May 3, 1886, president\u2019s\nannual report to the Columbia College board of trustees shows her dissertation to be\nas shown below in 1886. Nonetheless, in 1937, when she was seventy-four years old,\nWinifred Edgerton Merrill listed her dissertation as \u201c(1) Mathematical Astronomy.\n(a) Computation of the Orbit, the Comet of \u201983. Data furnished by Harvard Uni-\nversity. (b) Determination of Latitude and Longitude of New York City from Direct\nObservations. (2) Pure Mathematics. Translation and Relations of Various Systems\nof Coordinates. Published at Columbia University\u201d (Owens questionnaire). Dean\nGildersleeve also referred to the \ufb01rst part of this title when quoting the trustees\nminutes of January 7, 1884: Edgerton \u201chas pursued for several years a line of study\nin the pure and applied mathematics, and in mathematical Astronomy, in which\nshe has shown an extraordinary pro\ufb01ciency, concluding with an independent calcu-\nlation of the orbit of a comet from data furnished by the Observatory at Harvard\u201d\n(Winifred Edgerton Merrill \ufb01le). Furthermore, a Columbia University timeline enti-\ntled \u201cWomen at Columbia\u201d shows that in 1886 \u201cColumbia awards its \ufb01rst degree to\na woman, a PhD in astronomy to Wellesley College graduate Winifred Edgerton.\u201d\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMERRILL, W. E. - 3\n\nAfter receiving her PhD, Edgerton remained at Mrs. Reed\u2019s school for a year as\nvice-principal until her marriage on September 1, 1887, to Frederick James Hamil-\nton Merrill (1861\u20131916). She had been \u201co\ufb00ered the professorship of mathematics\nand astronomy [at Wellesley] but declined it in preference for marriage\u201d (\u201cFirst\nAlumna Button-Holed Trustees for Degree,\u201d Columbia Alumni News, 28 Apr 1939).\nFrederick Merrill was born in New York City, received a bachelor\u2019s degree from the\nColumbia School of Mines in 1885, worked on the New Jersey Geological Survey,\nand returned to the School of Mines on a fellowship in 1886 while still working\non the geological survey. At the time of their marriage, F. J. H. Merrill was an\ninstructor in paleontology and geology at Columbia; he received his PhD in 1890.\nFrom 1890 to 1904 he held various positions with the state of New York in Albany,\nincluding director of the New York State Museum.\n\nIn 1888 Winifred Edgerton Merrill was asked to serve on a small committee\nto form a separate woman\u2019s college to be part of Columbia. Because there were\nmen on the committee and it met in an o\ufb03ce in downtown Manhattan, Frederick\nMerrill disapproved; as a result she resigned from the committee. However, her\nname appears on the request to Columbia\u2019s trustees asking for the establishment\nof such a woman\u2019s college. The resulting school, Barnard College, was founded in\n1889, shortly after President Barnard\u2019s death. In Howson\u2019s 1944 interview, Merrill\nrecounted an instance of disapproval from her husband that occurred while they\nwere living in Albany: \u201cI was asked to be on the school board. Lieutenant-Governor\nHerrick came in to ask me. My husband did not speak to me for two days. He was\nborn in New York and had these ideas of what was proper for women to do\u201d\n(Winifred Edgerton Merrill \ufb01le).\n\nIn 1900 Frederick Merrill was New York state geologist. At that time, the family\nwas living in Albany and those enumerated in the household were Frederick and\nWinifred, three children, a cook, a butler, a chambermaid, and a nurse. Their eldest\nchild, Louise (1888\u20131982), was born in New Jersey; Hamilton (1890\u20131982), Winifred\n(1897\u20131943), and, later, Edgerton (1901\u20131960) were born in New York State. In\n1904 Frederick Merrill left Albany to become a mining geologist in New York City.\nIn 1907 he moved to Nogales, Arizona, and in 1913 to California. Winifred Edgerton\nMerrill and her children remained in the New York City area. F. J. H. Merrill died\nin 1916 in Los Angeles.\n\nWhile raising her family, Winifred Merrill remained active in educational endeav-\nors. She taught at the Emma Willard School in Troy 1894\u201395, served as an alumna\ntrustee of Wellesley 1898\u20131904, was president of the Wellesley Alumnae Association\n1889\u201390, served on the Association of Collegiate Alumnae Committee on Collegiate\nAdministration 1899\u20131904, and was also a member of Albany\u2019s Monday Evening\nand Thursday Morning clubs.\n\nAfter her return to the New York City area, Winifred Edgerton Merrill resumed\nher teaching career as the head of the mathematics department of a girls\u2019 school,\nHighcli\ufb00 Hall, in Yonkers. In 1906 she founded the Oaksmere School for Girls, a\nnon-sectarian boarding school in Westchester County, New York. In 1910 Winifred\nMerrill, her four children, and several servants were living in New Rochelle, where\nshe was principal of the school. The school was \ufb01rst in New Rochelle but soon\nmoved to her estate on Long Island Sound in the village of Larchmont, a part of\nthe town of Mamaroneck. Merrill directed the school, which was also known as\nMrs. Merrill\u2019s School and the Merrill School, for twenty years. She opened a branch\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMERRILL, W. E. - 4\n\nin Paris, Oaksmere Abroad, in 1912 and returned from Europe with her younger\ndaughter, Winifred, in September of that year. Merrill made several trips to Europe\nagain in the early 1920s, usually traveling with her daughter Winifred and once with\nWinifred and her son Edgerton. A 1922 wedding announcement for her daughter\nWinifred refers to Edgerton Hall in Mamaroneck as Merrill\u2019s country home.\n\nWinifred Merrill was supportive of America\u2019s participation in the \ufb01rst interna-\ntional track meet for women, which was held in Paris in August 1922. The East-\nern trials were held at Oaksmere, and, according to the New York Times, Merrill\n\u201cagreed to entertain America\u2019s team and pay all its expenses while it is in Paris, in\naddition to donating the use of Oaksmere School and its equipment for the May 13\nmeet\u201d (April 16, 1922). In 1928 Merrill closed Oaksmere, and on September 26th\nof that year her appointment as \u201cdirector of the Three Arts Wing of The Barbi-\nzon for students of music, drama, and art\u201d was announced in an advertisement in\nthe New York Times. Some sources indicate that she moved from Mamaroneck to\nthe Barbizon Hotel in New York City in 1926 and served as the librarian for that\nresidence hotel for women.\n\nIn 1918 Merrill published a brochure, Musical Autograms, the origin of which she\n\nexplained in the preface.\n\nIn my early education I was greatly impressed by a book by Ben-\njamin Peirce, entitled \u201cIdeality in the Physical Science\u201d, and it was\nthe in\ufb02uence of this book upon my mentality that some years later\nled me to choose as the subject of the thesis for my Doctor\u2019s degree\nin Mathematics, at Columbia University \u201cThe Uni\ufb01cation of the\nSeveral Systems of Mathematical Co-ordinates.\u201d Consciously and\nunconsciously throughout a busy life . . . I continued this mental\nsearch for co-ordinating elements in life-experiences, in art-forms,\nin the complexities of educational problems, always searching for\na better understanding of the nature of things through some un-\nderlying unifying principle. . . .\n\nMy present invention is founded upon the principle that ev-\nery line or point in nature or in art or in science is subject to\nmathematical expression through some one of the many systems\nof co-ordinates or reference axes, among which I include one which\nI denominate \u201cMusical Axes.\u201d The lines referred to may exist in\nnature, art or science, or be seen in the imagination, but are subject\nalways to the mathematical law and are thus capable of relative\nexpression. (Musical Autograms, iii\u2013iv)\n\nShe then produced \u201cmelodic outlines\u201d based on the signatures of twenty famous\nmen. These outlines were set to music by Robert Russell Bennett and printed\nby the music publisher G. Schirmer, for whom Bennett was then a copyist and\narranger. Bennett later became famous as an orchestrator of Broadway and movie\nmusicals. He wrote in his autobiography that \u201cit was her hope that a person\u2019s\nsignature, written across a musical sta\ufb00, would furnish a melodic line expressive of\nthat person\u2019s character, and possibly his or her mood at the time of signing\u201d (p.\n49). Bennett later played the music for Merrill at \u201ca talk on Musical Autograms to\nan important group in Chicago\u201d (p. 56) and then opened \u201cthe short-lived Musical\nAutograms shop . . . on Lexington Avenue\u201d in New York City (p. 58n). Merrill\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMERRILL, W. E. - 5\n\nintroduced Bennett to her daughters, and in 1919 he married her eldest daughter,\nLouise.\n\nIn addition to her contributions to the books by Maude Fiero Barnes on Italian\nart and historic periods noted in the introduction to Renaissance Vistas and the\neditor\u2019s note to Historic Vistas, Merrill held the copyright on these volumes of\nessays, some of which had been presented as lectures at Oaksmere during the 1910s.\nIn 1933, for the \ufb01ftieth anniversary of her graduation from Wellesley, her class,\ntogether with the Woman\u2019s Graduate Club of Columbia University and the Zeta\nChapter of Phi Delta Gamma, presented Columbia with a portrait of Winifred\nEdgerton Merrill. The painting, by Mrs. H. E. Ogden Campbell, bears the inscrip-\ntion \u201cShe opened the door,\u201d and was \ufb01rst hung in Philosophy Hall but later moved\nto Low Library. The painting was accepted by her fellow teacher from the 1880s,\nColumbia president Nicholas Murray Butler.\n\nIn addition to her involvement with the Wellesley Alumnae Association and\nboard of trustees, Merrill served as president of the Diocesan Branch of the Woman\u2019s\nAuxiliary of Albany, of the New York Branch of the Intercollegiate Alumnae Asso-\nciation, and of the Barbizon Book and Pen Club. She was a member of the Women\u2019s\nGraduate Club of Columbia University, the Women\u2019s University Club, the Woman\u2019s\nClub of Larchmont, the Classical and Wellesley clubs of New York City, the Zeta\nChapter of Phi Delta Gamma, and, while at Wellesley, Zeta Alpha. She held a\nlife membership in the AAAS. A 1939 article in the Columbia Alumni News noted\nthat \u201cshe has four children and \ufb01ve grandchildren, resides at The Barbizon, is a\nvehement supporter of President Roosevelt among a family of Republicans and\nwas active in the campaign to repeal the eighteenth amendment, speaking from\nsoapboxes throughout the city.\u201d\n\nFor the last two years of her life, Merrill lived with her son Hamilton in Fair-\n\ufb01eld, Connecticut, and died a few weeks before her eighty-ninth birthday in nearby\nStratford. Her funeral was held in Trinity (Episcopal) Church in New York, the\nsame church in which she had been married.

December 1, 1847\u2013March 5, 1930.\nVassar College (BA 1869), Johns Hopkins University (PhD completed 1882,\nawarded 1926).\n\nChristine Ladd was born in Windsor, Connecticut, the eldest of the three children\nof Augusta F. (Niles) (1825\u20131860) and Eliphalet Ladd (1822\u20131885). Both of her\nparents came from old New England families, her father\u2019s from New Hampshire\nand her mother\u2019s from Connecticut. Her parents married in 1846. Her brother,\nHenry (b. 1850), was born while the family lived in New York where her father\nwas a merchant. Her sister, Jane Augusta (b. 1854), was born after the family had\nmoved to her maternal grandmother\u2019s home in the Poquonock section of Windsor in\n1853. Many years later Ladd described her father as having been both a merchant\nand a gentleman farmer. Ladd\u2019s mother, who was a supporter of women\u2019s rights,\ndied of pneumonia when Ladd was twelve. Soon after her mother\u2019s death Ladd\nbegan keeping a journal. In 1862 her father married Mary E. Barnes (1839\u20131903),\nand they had two children, Katharine (b. 1865) and George B. (1867\u20131881).\n\nFrom 1860 to 1863, Ladd attended schools in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, while\nliving with her paternal grandmother. She spent the next two years at a college\npreparatory school, the Wesleyan Academy. The school had been coeducational\nsince it opened in Wilbraham, Massachusetts, in 1825 because \u201cin the school as in\nthe [Methodist] church, the sexes were to have a common platform of opportunity\u201d\n(Sherman, History of the Wesleyan Academy, 77). Nonetheless, the male and fe-\nmale students were enrolled in di\ufb00erent courses of study, and at graduation males\npresented orations and females presented essays. Although a number of sources\nsay that Ladd graduated as valedictorian of her class, the program for the June\n1865 \u201cAnniversary Exercises of Wesleyan Academy\u201d lists another female student as\npresenting the \u201cValedictory Essay\u201d and Ladd as presenting the \u201cClassical Essay.\u201d\nJust before leaving for her second year at Wilbraham, Ladd saw a notice an-\nnouncing the planned opening of Vassar College in fall 1865. She hoped to attend\nbut did not think her father would \u201cgive his consent to such a Quixotic scheme\u201d\n(Ladd Diary, 10 Aug 1864). In fact, Ladd\u2019s father, who was very supportive of her\nstudies at Wilbraham, had \ufb01nancial and health problems in the mid-1860s, and\nLadd spent 1865\u201366, the year after she graduated from Wilbraham, at home in\nPoquonock with her infant half-sister. Her maternal grandmother, eighty-one years\nold in 1865, was not supportive of her furthering her education, thinking that Ladd\nwould not be able to \ufb01nd a husband after college. However, by the end of July 1866\nLadd had convinced her grandmother to support her plans to attend college and\nhad convinced her mother\u2019s older sister, Juliet Niles, to pay the tuition. At \ufb01rst\nher father did not approve her plans but agreed in a short time, and in Septem-\nber 1866 Ladd enrolled at Vassar. Ladd studied at Vassar 1866\u201367 and 1868\u201369.\nShe did not return 1867\u201368 because of a lack of funds; instead, she spent the fall\nsemester teaching in Utica, New York. At Vassar she was in\ufb02uenced strongly by\nthe astronomer Maria Mitchell and by Charles S. Farrar, professor of mathematics,\nnatural philosophy, and chemistry. She was most interested in physics, particularly\nin the vibrations of the elastic pendulum.\n\nAfter graduating from Vassar in 1869, Ladd began teaching at a girls\u2019 school in\nHollidaysburg, a town near Altoona in the mountains of central Pennsylvania. She\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLADD-FRANKLIN - 2\n\nspent two years there and at the beginning of her second year teaching reported\nthat she was doing \u201cspecial investigations in Physics, and in mathematical research\u201d\n(letter to Auntie [Juliet Niles], 7 Sep 1870). In May 1871 she was o\ufb00ered, and\naccepted, a position at a seminary in Washington, Pennsylvania, in the southwestern\npart of the state. While in Washington, she studied with George C. Vose, a professor\nof mathematics at Washington and Je\ufb00erson College, then a small all-male liberal\narts college. Ladd described Vose as \u201camong the \ufb01rst ten or twelve mathematicians\nin the country . . . [who] leaves his family to poverty and dirt, while he absorbs\nhimself in Quarternions [sic]\u201d (Ladd Diary, 14 Nov 1871). Prior to working with\nVose, Ladd had considered studying in Cambridge, Massachusetts, with James Mills\nPeirce or in St. Louis, Missouri, with William Chauvenet. In a June 9, 1872, entry in\nher diary Ladd mentions what appears to be her \ufb01rst publication in mathematics,\na problem on quaternions that appeared in the London Educational Times. One\nmonth later, on July 16, she wrote in her diary that she had intended to spend the\nentire summer vacation studying with Vose; however, her brother had intimated in\na letter \u201cthat \ufb01lial obligations require my presence at home,\u201d so she would stay in\nPennsylvania only until the end of the month.\n\nThe last entry in the Ladd diaries preserved at Vassar College was on April 27,\n1873, and was written while she was living with relatives in Boston, Massachusetts.\nIt begins, \u201cFrom October to January, Mathematical courses at Harvard University.\nNot as pro\ufb01table as they might have been, as they were not followed by an examina-\ntion.\u201d Although the \u201cHarvard Annex,\u201d the precursor to Radcli\ufb00e College o\ufb03cially\nknown as the Cambridge Society for the Collegiate Instruction of Women, was not\nfounded until 1879, and there is no record of Ladd\u2019s having attended classes at Har-\nvard, she reported in November 1872 that she was regularly enrolled as a student\nthere and was attending lectures of W. E. Byerly, then a graduate student, and J.\nM. Peirce, \u201cJimmie Mills as we Harvard fellows call him\u201d (letter to Auntie, 3 Nov\n1872, Box 2, Christine Ladd Franklin and Fabian Franklin papers). Although the\n\ufb01nal entry in her diary concludes: \u201cHave applied for a second degree at Vassar\u201d (27\nApr 1873), Ladd did not continue her formal studies at the time. She remained in\nthe Boston area, taught at Chelsea High School, and continued her informal work\nin mathematics. In early 1875 Ladd\u2019s \ufb01rst publication, other than problems and\ntheir solutions, appeared in the Analyst, the recently founded American journal,\nwhich became the Annals of Mathematics in 1884. In it she reported on the con-\ntents of the Journal f\u00a8ur die reine und angewandte Mathematik (Crelle\u2019s Journal),\none of the most important European mathematical journals, and noted that in the\nBoston Public Library the journal was on the shelves with its leaves uncut.\n\nBy the spring of 1875 Ladd was teaching in Union Springs, New York. In the\nspring of 1876 she met friends from Woods Hole while visiting nearby Cornell\nUniversity and spent some time studying biology. It appears that she also studied\nmathematics at Cornell. J. L. Coolidge\u2019s obituary of W. E. Byerly in the Bulletin\nof the AMS notes that Ladd was a student of Byerly when he was an assistant\nprofessor at Cornell 1873\u201376. It also suggests that Byerly\u2019s experience teaching her\nmay have been a factor in his \u201cfavorable opinion of the intellectual capacity of\nwomen\u201d and his 1879 support for providing private classes for women at Harvard,\nwhere he was then an assistant professor (p. 296).\n\nLadd remained in Union Springs through at least May 1878. In a letter of March\n1877 she reported that she was writing a mathematics book. Also while in Union\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLADD-FRANKLIN - 3\n\nSprings, problems that she posed and those that she solved appeared frequently in\nthe Educational Times; the Analyst; the Mathematical Visitor ; and a local newspa-\nper, the Yates County Chronicle. From the \ufb01rst issue of the Mathematical Visitor\n(October 1877) we learn that Ladd is \u201cProfessor of Natural Sciences and Chemistry,\nHowland School, Union Springs, Cayuga County, New York.\u201d\n\nOn March 27, 1878, Ladd wrote to J. J. Sylvester asking him whether Johns\nHopkins University would refuse her permission to listen to his lectures \u201con account\nof [her] sex?\u201d (Gilman Papers). At the time she did not mention her publications\nbut described herself only as \u201ca graduate of Vassar College . . . [who had] attended\nmathematical lectures at Harvard University.\u201d On April 2, 1878, Sylvester wrote\nDaniel Coit Gilman, president of Johns Hopkins, that he \u201cshould rejoice to have\nher as a fellow worker among us. . . . My own impression is that her presence among\nus would be a source of additional strength to the University.\u201d In an undated letter\ndetailing Ladd\u2019s accomplishments he noted that \u201cshe is favorably known to Dr.\nSalmon and Prof. Cayley with each of whom she has corresponded on Mathematical\nsubjects correcting an error or imperfection in a treatise of the one and suggesting\nan improvement in a memoir or book of the other. She is well known in America\nand England and in a second number of The Analyst . . . she has written a profound\npaper on Quaternions\u201d (Gilman Papers).\n\nDespite this endorsement by Sylvester, Johns Hopkins would not admit her, or\nany other woman, as a student. However, the executive committee of the board of\ntrustees was \u201cwilling that the Faculty should examine & certify to the attainments\nof ladies who may o\ufb00er themselves, without having been instructed here, as can-\ndidates for academic degrees\u201d (D. C. Gilman to Miss Ladd, April 26, 1878, MS 1,\nDaniel Coit Gilman Papers, Special Collections, Sheridan Libraries, The Johns Hop-\nkins University). They also consented to her attending Sylvester\u2019s lectures without\ncharging her tuition.\n\nLadd spent the next four years studying at Johns Hopkins and traveling in\nEurope. During this time she was not o\ufb03cially enrolled in the university but, at\ntimes, received the stipend of a fellow. She continued contributing to the Edu-\ncational Times and the Analyst and published substantial articles in the second\nand third volumes of the American Journal of Mathematics. She appears to have\nenjoyed strong support from the mathematics faculty. An apparently unsolicited\nletter from William E. Story, Thomas Craig, Fabian Franklin, and O. H. Mitchell\nsuggested that she be given the fellow\u2019s stipend upon her return from an extended\ntrip to Europe in early 1882. The spring 1882 term was her last at Johns Hopkins.\nWhat should have been her dissertation for an 1882 PhD was published in Studies\nin Logic by Members of the Johns Hopkins University, which was edited by her\nadvisor, C. S. Peirce, brother of J. M. Peirce with whom Ladd had studied at Har-\nvard. However, the board of trustees did not permit her to be awarded the degree\nbecause she was a woman.\n\nOn August 24, 1882, Ladd married Fabian Franklin (1853\u20131939), a member of\nthe Johns Hopkins mathematics faculty. Franklin was born in Eger, Hungary, im-\nmigrated to the United States when he was four, received his bachelor\u2019s degree from\nColumbian College (now George Washington University) in 1869, worked as a civil\nengineer and surveyor until 1877, and earned his PhD in mathematics at Johns Hop-\nkins in 1880. In June 1883, their infant son died shortly after his birth. Two months\nlater, on August 17, Lucien A. Wait, then associate professor of mathematics at\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLADD-FRANKLIN - 4\n\nCornell, wrote to Fabian Franklin: \u201cI am very glad to hear that Mrs. Franklin has\nso much improved. Her acceptance of work in my correspondence University gives\nme great pleasure\u201d (Box 6, Christine Ladd Franklin and Fabian Franklin Papers).\nHowever, there is no indication that she ever actively participated in this venture.\nThe following summer she gave birth to a daughter, Margaret Ladd Franklin.\n\nAlthough Christine Ladd-Franklin never held a regular position in Baltimore,\nin 1887 she reported that she taught \u201cfor an hour or so every morning in Miss\nRandolph\u2019s school\u201d and that she had \u201cno private pupils at present\u201d (letter to Auntie,\n14 Nov 1887). Later, in 1889, she turned down a position as lecturer at Bryn Mawr.\nDuring this time she continued her mathematical research and began a career in the\narea of physiological optics. Her \ufb01rst paper in this \ufb01eld, which was a mathematical\ninvestigation of binocular vision, appeared in 1887. That same year Vassar College\nbestowed on her an LLD, the only honorary degree it has ever granted. During this\nperiod some of her papers appeared under the hyphenated name Christine Ladd-\nFranklin, but she did not use this name consistently until about 1905; before then\nher name appeared in various forms including C. Ladd Franklin.\n\nIn 1891 Fabian Franklin took a sabbatical leave in Germany with his wife and\ndaughter. Ladd-Franklin spent part of that year in G\u00a8ottingen in the laboratory of\nG. E. M\u00a8uller but was denied the o\ufb03cial status of student. She also spent part of\nthe year in Berlin working in Hermann von Helmholtz\u2019s laboratory. While in Berlin\nshe began a correspondence with Felix Klein concerning the admission of women\nto G\u00a8ottingen. In May 1892 she learned from Klein that \u201cfor the time being [the\nG\u00a8ottingen faculty] mainly support only what will not satisfy you, the admission of\nfemale guest auditors (under control of the prorector [vice chancellor] and with the\nassumed assent of each individual docent)\u201d (Box 4, Christine Ladd Franklin and\nFabian Franklin papers). The next summer, at the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition\nin Chicago, she met Mary Frances Winston (Newson), who was to become one\nof the \ufb01rst three guest students and the \ufb01rst American woman to earn a PhD in\nmathematics from a German university. When Winston did not receive a fellowship\nfrom the Association for Collegiate Alumnae (ACA, later AAUW) in order to attend\nG\u00a8ottingen, Ladd-Franklin o\ufb00ered her $500 to help cover her costs for the year.\n\nIn 1894 Ladd-Franklin returned to Berlin without her family in order to work for\nseveral months on her theory of color vision in Arthur K\u00a8onig\u2019s laboratory. She had\nannounced her \ufb01rst results in this area two years earlier and continued publishing in\nit for another thirty years. In a 2000 article, D. C. McCarty included Ladd-Franklin\namong seven names that appeared in \u201cname indices of historical works on logic\nand . . . on those on nineteenth century perceptual physiology\u201d and noted that \u201cin\nthose days, a liaison between thought and sight was recorded in the vocabulary that\nphysiologists and psychologists adopted for visual processes and phenomena\u201d (p.\n368). It was on the basis of work in this \ufb01eld that in 1906 Christine Ladd-Franklin\nwas starred for psychology in the \ufb01rst edition of American Men of Science. It was\nalso on the basis of this work that she was o\ufb00ered an honorary doctorate by Johns\nHopkins to be bestowed during the university\u2019s \ufb01ftieth anniversary celebration in\n1926. Rather than accept the honorary degree, she asked for, and received, the\ndoctorate she had earned forty-four years earlier.\n\nDuring the time that she was working in the theory of color vision, Ladd-Franklin\nkept up her interest in logic. In 1892 she published a review of the \ufb01rst volume of\nErnst Schr\u00a8oder\u2019s Vorlesungen \u00a8uber die Algebra der Logik ; that review has been\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLADD-FRANKLIN - 5\n\ncited frequently in articles on the history of logic. In 1893 she asked to give a series\nof lectures on that subject at Johns Hopkins and was turned down. Starting in\n1904 she became the only woman on the Johns Hopkins faculty, teaching there\nas a part-time lecturer in logic and psychology while being paid considerably less\nthan the $500 stipend she had received as a student. There was no question of\nanti-nepotism practices keeping her from being hired since Fabian Franklin had\nresigned his position as associate professor at Johns Hopkins in 1895 in order to\nbecome editor of the Baltimore News. She remained a part-time lecturer until 1909\nwhen she moved to New York with her family. The move to New York was to allow\nFabian Franklin to take a job as an associate editor of the New York Evening Post.\nHe resigned that position in February 1917 over a political disagreement with the\npaper\u2019s owner and in 1919 started his own literary and political weekly publication,\nThe Review, which later merged with The Independent to become The Independent\nand The Weekly Review . While in New York, Christine Ladd-Franklin taught as an\nunpaid part-time lecturer in logic and psychology at Columbia University.\n\nIn addition to her many scholarly publications, Ladd-Franklin frequently wrote\npopular articles and letters to newspapers and news magazines, none of which\nare included in her list of publications below. These were mainly concerned with\nwomen\u2019s rights, but also addressed other current events in which she had an inter-\nest, such as the use of Esperanto or the less well known international language Ido.\nShe worked particularly hard in the cause of women\u2019s higher education. In 1897 she\nwas involved in the formation of an organization to advance this cause, the Balti-\nmore Association for the Promotion of the University Education of Women, and\nserved as its chairman pro tem. This association tried to get Johns Hopkins to open\nits graduate school to women. This attempt was not successful, and the trustees\ndid not agree to enroll women o\ufb03cially in graduate courses until 1907. At various\ntimes Ladd-Franklin served on the ACA committee on fellowships, serving as its\n\ufb01rst chairman, and speaking to that association on \u201cThe Usefulness of Fellowships\u201d\nin October 1894. That talk was reprinted in the AAUW Journal in March 1953 with\nthe comment that \u201csixty-three years later, it strikes such a sympathetic chord for\nthose of us most closely associated with our fellowship program that we cannot\nresist representing it here in its entirety\u201d (46:166). In 1899\u20131900 she and the three\nwomen who had received ACA European fellowships in mathematics, Ruth Gen-\ntry, Annie MacKinnon (Fitch), and Mary Winston (Newson), served on the ACA\nCouncil to Accredit Women for Advanced Work in Foreign Universities. She was\nalso instrumental in the establishment of the Sarah Berliner fellowship and served\nas chairman of the committee that made the award until 1919 when the AAUW\ntook over that role.\n\nChristine Ladd-Franklin\u2019s scholarly bibliography includes over one hundred arti-\ncles and reviews in logic and color theory. In 1929, the year before she died, a volume\ncontaining her collected works on color vision was published in the series Interna-\ntional Library of Psychology, Philosophy, and Scienti\ufb01c Method; it was reprinted\nin 1973 in the series Classics in Psychology. In addition to the selected publications\nlisted below and the many papers in color theory, there are additional mathematical\nworks, published mainly under the name Ladd, including more than \ufb01fty solutions\nof questions from the Educational Times and the Analyst, some of which were ab-\nstracted in the Jahrb\u00a8uch \u00a8uber die Fortschritte der Mathematik (JFM) or listed in\nAlonzo Church\u2019s \u201cBibliography of Symbolic Logic (1666\u20131935)\u201d in the inaugural\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLADD-FRANKLIN - 6\n\nvolume of the Journal of Symbolic Logic. Church also listed articles that she had\nwritten for J. Mark Baldwin\u2019s 1902 Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology, for\nwhich she served as associate editor for logic and psychology. In addition, Church\u2019s\nbibliography included an article on symbolic logic, which Ladd-Franklin had coau-\nthored with E. V. Huntington, that appeared in the 1905 Encyclopedia Americana;\nin 1908 E. B. Wilson wrote in a review of a 1906 \u201ccritical-historical study of the\nlogical calculus\u201d that \u201cthe mathematician is almost certain to \ufb01nd more of value\nto him in the excellent though brief account of symbolic logic\u201d by Huntington and\nLadd-Franklin (p. 190). In 1938 she was described as \u201calways militant in behalf of\nher color theory and the rights of women\u201d (Boring, 414). Her work in logic was\nexamined in a 1999 article in the Bulletin of Symbolic Logic.\n\nChristine Ladd-Franklin died of pneumonia at age eighty-two at her home in\n\nNew York City in 1930. She was survived by her husband and her daughter.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AAAS, Optical Soc., Philos. Assoc., Psych.

      "text": "PORTER, Goldie (Horton). September 4, 1887\u2013May 11, 1972.\nUniversity of Texas (BA 1908, PhD 1916), Smith College (MA 1910).\n\nGoldie Printis Horton was the youngest of three surviving daughters, of four\nchildren born, of Colistia (Polk) (b. 1861), a Texas native, and John Thomas Horton\n(b. 1857), originally from Missouri. Her parents married in about 1881. She was born\nin 1887 in Athens, Texas, and her older sisters were Mary Coral (1882\u20131967) and\nLillian Pearl (b. 1885). Her father was a physician, and in 1900 and 1910 the family\nlived in Quanah, Texas, just below the southeastern part of the Texas panhandle.\nGoldie Horton attended public schools in Quanah before entering the University\nof Texas in 1904. While at the university she was secretary-treasurer of her senior\nclass and was a member of the YWCA. She graduated from Texas in 1908 before her\ntwenty-\ufb01rst birthday. Her sister Pearl also received a BA from Texas in 1908 and\nwas a public school teacher for some time after her graduation. Her eldest sister,\nCoral, studied at the University of Texas, taught school, married, and then earned a\nBA in 1924 and an MA in 1927 from Texas. Coral was a member of the University\nof Texas history department until her retirement in 1959 as assistant professor;\nshe was associated with the Texas State Historical Association as corresponding\nsecretary 1927-42 and corresponding secretary and treasurer 1942\u201367.\n\nAfter receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree, Goldie Horton taught in the high school\nin Grandview, Texas, for a year before going to Smith College in Northampton,\nMassachusetts, with a fellowship in 1909. Records at Smith show that on October\n11, 1909, Horton was made an honorary member of the mathematics club of the\ncollege, and on March 14, 1910, she gave a talk to the club on \u201cMotion of Aggregate\nPoints.\u201d She completed her master\u2019s thesis, \u201cThe development of analysis,\u201d in May\n1910 and returned to Texas, where she taught at the high school in Amarillo for\nthe next two years, 1910\u201312. Horton then studied at Bryn Mawr College as a fellow\n1912\u201313.\n\nIn 1913 Goldie Horton was hired as a tutor at Texas. She also continued her\ngraduate work and in 1916 completed the work for her PhD with a dissertation in\nanalysis written under the direction of M. B. Porter; the approval sheet was also\nsigned by H. J. Ettlinger and E. L. Dodd. Horton wrote in the dissertation: \u201cI\ntake the greatest pleasure in expressing my deep appreciation of the ready counsel\nand invaluable assistance given me by Professor Milton Brockett Porter, who for\nmany years has been my teacher and friend and whose kind interest inspired me to\ncontinue my studies.\u201d This was the \ufb01rst doctoral degree in mathematics awarded\nat Texas. She was also the \ufb01rst woman to receive a PhD in any \ufb01eld at Texas.\n\nGoldie Horton remained a tutor until 1917 when she was promoted to instructor\nin pure mathematics; in 1926 she was promoted to adjunct professor and in 1935\nto assistant professor. According to Robert E. Greenwood\u2019s \u201cIn Memoriam,\u201d in the\nsummer of 1921 she worked on the preparation of ballistic tables at the Aberdeen\nProving Ground in Maryland. Her parents were still living in Quanah in 1920, but\nGoldie Horton and her widowed mother were living together in Austin in 1930.\n\nIn 1934 Horton and Milton Brockett Porter, her colleague and dissertation advi-\nsor of eighteen years earlier, had notes for a text reproduced by Edwards Brothers\nof Ann Arbor, Michigan, a company that often produced lithographs of lecture\nnotes. On December 26 of that year she and Porter were married. This was the\nthird marriage for M. B. Porter, who had been twice widowed. Milton Brockett\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nPORTER - 2\n\nPorter was born on November 22, 1869, in Sherman, Texas. He received a BS in\n1892 from the University of Texas and an MA in 1895 and a PhD in 1897 from\nHarvard University. After working as a private tutor in Texas and teaching at the\nUniversity of Texas and at Yale University, he returned in 1902 as professor in pure\nmathematics to the University of Texas, where he remained until his retirement in\n1945. M. B. Porter died in Austin on May 27, 1960.\n\nGoldie Porter, still an assistant professor, stopped teaching full time and went\non modi\ufb01ed service in 1958. She continued part-time teaching until her retirement\nin 1966, when she was granted the title professor emeritus. Goldie Horton Porter\nwas active in various organizations in Texas, particularly before she married. In\n1919 she served as chair of the mathematics section of the Texas State Teachers\u2019\nAssociation. She served as an o\ufb03cer of, gave talks to, and hosted parties for The\nPentagram, the mathematics club at the university. Furthermore, she was a founder,\nin 1920, of the University of Texas chapter of Alpha Phi, a social sorority, and in\n1923, of the Austin chapter of AAUW, which she also served as treasurer, secretary,\nand president. In the late 1930s she described herself as a Democrat and indicated\ninterests in gardening and housekeeping.\n\nIn 1930 Goldie Horton and her mother, then almost seventy years old, had a\nhouse built in Austin where the Porters lived after their marriage. Greenwood\nnoted:\n\nIt soon became a misnomer to refer to the establishment as only\na residence. It also became a library and a museum. Though both\nthe Porters were avid readers they were obliged to curtail their\nacquisition of books only when they had no more place to store\nthem. The Porters were lovers of music as well. Dr. M. B. Porter\nwas an accomplished \ufb02utist, and Goldie served as his accompanist\nat the frequent informal musicales.\n\nAn amateur astronomer, Professor M. B. Porter had a small\ntelescope at the Porter Museum and a sundial placed in the gar-\ndens.

After the\nPorters\u2019 heirs had selected various pieces from the estate, such a\nvast collection remained that a two-day auction attracted a large\naudience, for the Porter collection was well-known for its coverage\nand depth.

August 24, 1888\u2013March 11, 1977.\nIowa State College of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (BS 1909), Cornell\nUniversity (MA 1915, PhD 1926).\n\nEugenia Fae Farnum, born in Spencer, Iowa, was the second of four children of\nJosephine (Jacobs), born in 1857 in New York State, and George Edwin Farnum,\nborn in 1851 in New Hampshire. Her parents married in about 1875, and her father\nwas a farmer in northwestern Iowa at the time of the 1900 census. Her siblings\nwere an older brother, Roswell (1886\u20131917), and younger sisters, Anna (b. 1892)\nand Martha B. (b. 1894). In 1920 the family was living in Ames, Iowa, where Fay\nwas an instructor at Iowa State College, Anna did clerical work for the Treasury\nDepartment in Washington, D.C., and Martha was a college chemistry instructor.\nSubsequently, Martha Belle Farnum received an MA in biology in 1922 and a PhD\nin biochemistry in 1926 from the University of Chicago.\n\nFarnum graduated with a degree in general science from Iowa State College of\nAgriculture and Mechanic Arts (now Iowa State University of Science and Technol-\nogy) in 1909. Between 1909 and 1914 she taught in high schools in Lyons, LeMars,\nand Ames, Iowa. She attended Cornell University 1914\u201315 and received her mas-\nter\u2019s degree in 1915 having written her thesis using the name Fae Farnum. By the\nlate teens she used only the name Fay Farnum.\n\nFarnum then returned to Iowa where she was an instructor at Iowa State 1915\u2013\n24. She attended the University of Chicago during the summers of 1921 and 1922.\nShe returned to study at Cornell during 1924\u201325 and registered only for thesis\nsupervision with Virgil Snyder in 1925\u201326. During her \ufb01nal year, Farnum was an\ninstructor and taught two classes per semester including solid geometry, advanced\nalgebra, and calculus. She received her doctorate in 1926 with her major subject\ngeometry, her \ufb01rst minor mathematical analysis, and her second minor physics.\n\nSoon after receiving her doctorate, Farnum began a lengthy period of teach-\ning at Washington Square College, New York University. She served as instructor\n1926\u201328 and then as assistant professor. During her early years at NYU, Farnum\noften taught two graduate courses a semester, mainly geometry but sometimes al-\ngebra or calculus of variations. By the mid-1930s she was more likely to teach two\nundergraduate courses and one graduate course. One of her students at NYU was\nGertrude Blanch, for whom Farnum served as a reference when Blanch applied to\nCornell for graduate school. During 1939\u201340 Farnum took a leave of absence from\nNYU to study at the Physics and Mathematics Institute in Copenhagen. She re-\nported to her father in Ames, Iowa, on the April 1940 Nazi invasion of Denmark\nand described her trip back to the United States via Berlin, Munich, the Brenner\nPass, Milan, and Genoa, where she took the USS Manhattan to New York.\n\nFarnum returned to NYU after her leave and taught for at least one more year,\n1940\u201341; both the undergraduate and graduate bulletins list her as scheduled to\nteach 1941\u201342. In 1943 she returned to the faculty of Iowa State, primarily to help\nthe mathematics department meet the extra teaching required by the naval and\narmy students. She was an assistant professor from 1943 to 1949, when she retired,\nand taught again as assistant professor 1955\u201357.\n\nFarnum was living at least part time in Tucson, Arizona, by about 1952.

April 18, 1895\u2013November 26, 1987.\nMonmouth College (BA 1916), University of Oklahoma (MA 1921), University\nof Chicago (PhD 1936).\n\nDora McFarland was born near Aledo, Illinois, the \ufb01rst of two children of Nell\n(Blayney) (1868\u20131912) and Edmund Curry McFarland (1866\u20131938), natives of Illi-\nnois who married in 1893. In 1900 this farm household also included a son, James\nRussell (b. 1897); Edmund McFarland\u2019s father; and a boarder.\n\nDora McFarland attended grade school and high school in Aledo, a small town in\nthe northern part of the state near the Mississippi River. She then attended nearby\nMonmouth College. After her graduation from college in 1916, she taught in high\nschools for a number of years: in Gravity, Iowa, 1916\u201317; Aledo, Illinois, 1917\u201319;\nand Sterling, Illinois, 1919\u201320.\n\nIn the summers of 1919 and 1920 McFarland took classes at the University of\nOklahoma before completing her work for her master\u2019s degree in 1921. She joined\nthe faculty there as instructor in 1921. Except for the years she was in residence at\nChicago for her doctoral work and for leaves, McFarland remained at Oklahoma the\nrest of her career. She was instructor 1921\u201327, assistant professor 1927\u201339, associate\nprofessor 1939\u201348, professor 1948\u201365, and emeritus professor after her retirement\nin 1965 at the age of seventy.\n\nMcFarland attended the University of Chicago for four quarters beginning in fall\n1924 while on leave from Oklahoma. While on a sabbatical in 1928\u201329, she returned\nto Chicago on a fellowship for four more quarters. She also took courses in spring\nand summer 1936 and \ufb01nished her dissertation in division algebras as a student of\nL. E. Dickson. She joined the AMS shortly after receiving her doctorate in 1936\nand remained a member the rest of her life.\n\nIn addition to teaching, which was her main contribution at Oklahoma, McFar-\nland did committee and administrative work and sponsored student organizations.\nDuring the 1930s and early 1940s she often served as an o\ufb03cer or sponsor of the\nOklahoma chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon, and in 1945\u201346 she served as chair of the\nOklahoma Section of the MAA. In the mid-1950s she contributed to a series of\ntape recordings made by members of the faculty and sold under the name \u201cTapes\nfor Teaching.\u201d McFarland\u2019s contribution was \u201cWhat should a high school student\nexpect from mathematics?\u201d She also ran several summer institutes for school math-\nematics and science teachers. Much of her teaching at the University of Oklahoma\nwas in mathematics education. In the early 1960s, she and Eunice M. Lewis, a col-\nleague in the education department, produced notes for an introductory course on\narithmetic for elementary teachers; in 1966 they published a more comprehensive\ntextbook for the same audience. In a review in Choice magazine, the book was\ncompared favorably with the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics\u2019 29th\nYearbook, Topics in Mathematics for Elementary School Teachers, and was \u201chighly\nrecommended\u201d (4 (1967): 712).\n\nMcFarland was active in a number of organizations not related to mathematics.\nShe was an elder in the Presbyterian church; was a member of the national board of\nthe YWCA; and was the Oklahoma founder, president, and international \ufb01rst vice\npresident of Delta Kappa Gamma, an honorary society for women in education. She\nwas also a member of Kappa Alpha Theta social sorority and in the early 1960s\ndescribed herself as a Democrat.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMcFARLAND - 2\n\nMcFarland was a recipient in 1949 of the Matrix Table award given by Theta\nSigma Phi (now Women in Communications, Inc.).

      "text": "REES, Mina S. August 2, 1902\u2013October 25, 1997.\nHunter College (BA 1923), Columbia University (Teachers College) (MA\n1925), University of Chicago (PhD 1931).\n\nMina Spiegel Rees was the youngest of two daughters and three sons of Alice\nLouise (Stackhouse) (b. 1870) and Moses Rees (b. 1858). Her mother was born in\nEngland and immigrated to the United States in 1883, and her father was born\nin New York of German parents; they married in about 1892. The older children\nwere Elsa I. (1893\u20131975), Albert L. (1894\u20131993), Clyde Harvey (1896\u20131967), and\nClarence Eugene (1898\u20131966). Mina Rees was born in Cleveland, Ohio, but the\nfamily moved to New York when she was a baby, and her early schooling was in\nthe New York City public schools.\n\nAfter graduating from Hunter College High School as valedictorian of her class\nin 1919, Mina Rees attended Hunter College where she was a mathematics major\nand very active in governance. She was president of her freshman and sophomore\nclasses and, during her senior year, of the Student Self Governance Association.\nDuring her junior year she served as editor-in-chief of the Hunter College yearbook,\nthe Wistarion. Rees graduated summa cum laude in 1923 and was awarded an \u201cH\u201d\npin as one of the seniors who \u201cdistinguished [her]self by signal service to Hunter\u201d\nduring her four years at college.\n\nAfter her graduation from Hunter, Rees was o\ufb00ered, but refused, a job at the\ncollege by the then chair Emma Requa, whose only degree was an 1898 BA from\nHunter. Rees related in 1969: \u201cI had formed a \ufb01rm opinion when I was an un-\ndergraduate that this was a bad mistake that the College was making, employing\npeople who had just graduated. I felt that the standards of the College were not high\nenough and that people should be better educated before they . . . became teachers\nthere. So, I said I could not under any circumstances, teach at the College because\nI wasn\u2019t [well enough educated].\u201d Rees also said that Requa \u201cwas appalled at any-\nthing like this, so she got me a job at Hunter High School\u201d (Interview by Merzbach,\n2). Rees was an assistant teacher at the high school and attended Columbia Uni-\nversity as a full-time graduate student. She recalled later that, \u201cwhen I had taken\nfour of their six-credit graduate courses in mathematics and was beginning to think\nabout a thesis, the word was conveyed to me \u2013 no o\ufb03cial ever told me this, but I\nlearned \u2013 that the Columbia mathematics department was really not interested in\nhaving women candidates for Ph.D.\u2019s. . . . That was the only episode that raised a\nquestion about the appropriateness of mathematics as a \ufb01eld for women before I\nhad my Ph.D. It was a really traumatic a\ufb00air for me\u201d (Dana and Hilton, \u201cMina\nRees,\u201d 258). Rees\u2019s perception is backed up by the fact that the department granted\nonly one PhD to a woman, Edna E. Kramer, between 1923 and 1939. Kramer, who\nhad graduated from Hunter in 1922, received her degree from Columbia in 1930.\n\nAfter she received her master\u2019s degree from Teachers College of Columbia Uni-\nversity in 1925, Rees was hired as instructor of mathematics at Hunter College.\nShe saved her money and in 1929 took a leave of absence from Hunter to enroll\nat the University of Chicago. She chose Chicago because she wanted to study with\nLeonard Eugene Dickson, whose 1923 Algebras and Their Arithmetics she had stud-\nied at Columbia. Unfortunately, when she arrived at Chicago, Dickson\u2019s attention\nhad turned to number theory, so she referred later to her having been \u201cvirtually\nself-educated\u201d (Interview by Merzbach, 3). On the other hand, Rees\u2019s arrival in\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nREES - 2\n\nChicago came at an opportune time for her; within a month she represented the\nHunter mathematics department at the inauguration of the university\u2019s new presi-\ndent and as such was one of the guests of honor at a dinner given by the Chicago\ndepartment. Rees reported later that soon after that dinner Dickson asked her to\nwrite her dissertation with him. She also reported that Dickson believed that, as\na mathematician, she probably was on a par with C. C. MacDu\ufb00ee. However, she\ndid not pursue a research career after her degree because, upon reviewing Oskar\nPerron\u2019s Algebra in 1933, she did not feel that she was educated properly in the\nnew Noetherian algebra.\n\nIn 1931 Rees completed her dissertation on certain kinds of division algebras,\nhaving had a fellowship her last year at Chicago. After receiving her degree in 1931\nRees returned to Hunter College as instructor. She was assistant professor 1932\u201340\nand became associate professor in 1940. In 1943 she took a leave of absence to\nwork for the newly established Applied Mathematics Panel (AMP) of the National\nDefense Research Committee. She remained o\ufb03cially on leave until 1950.\n\nRees described the work of the AMP as \u201can attempt to enlist the assistance of\ncivilian scientists outside the military to help the military . . . with weaponry and\nspeci\ufb01c work oriented toward winning the war. . . \u201d (Interview by Merzbach, 5). She\nserved as a technical aide and executive assistant to Warren Weaver, chief of the\nAMP. Rees was with the AMP until 1946, when she went to Washington, D.C.,\nto work for the O\ufb03ce of Naval Research (ONR). At ONR she was head of the\nmathematics branch 1946\u201349, director of the mathematical sciences division 1949\u2013\n52, and deputy science director 1952\u201353. In 1990 a statistician referred to Rees as\n\u201cthe angel of mathematics\u201d at ONR (Mood, \u201cMiscellaneous reminiscences,\u201d 39).\n\nThe signi\ufb01cance of her role during and just after the war was recognized in a\nresolution adopted by the council of the AMS at its annual meeting in December\n1953. It reads in part:\n\nThe very striking and brilliant contributions made by pure (non-\nmilitary, non-applied) science, not least of these by mathematics,\nto the winning of World War II is well known. It was clearly seen\nby the government and those responsible for the armed services\nthat a large scale fostering by the U.S. government of fundamental\nresearch, the basis of all research, was unavoidable. . . . Needless to\nsay as the purest of all sciences, mathematical research might well\nhave lagged behind in such an undertaking. That nothing of the\nsort happened is beyond any doubt traceable to one person\u2013Mina\nRees. Under her guidance, basic research in general, and especially\nin mathematics, received the most intelligent and wholehearted\nsupport. No greater wisdom and foresight could have been dis-\nplayed and the whole postwar development of mathematical re-\nsearch in the United States owes an immeasurable debt to the\npioneer work of the O\ufb03ce of Naval Research and to the alert, vig-\norous and farsighted policy conducted by Miss Rees. The in\ufb02uence\nof these policies has been such that it vitally a\ufb00ected later devel-\nopments: the activities of Air Force and Ordinance research, the\nNational Science Foundation itself. It is well known that in these\nmore recent organizations Mina Rees was constantly appealed to\nfor counsel and guidance. (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 60 (1954): 134)\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nREES - 3\n\nAlthough the Institute for Mathematical Statistics adopted a similar resolution,\nin 1987 Albert H. Bowker, a statistician from Stanford University who had been\nchancellor of the City University of New York 1961\u201372, said that he had \u201calways\nthought that Mina and ONR have not been given enough credit for the development\nof mathematical statistics in this country\u201d (Olkin, 475). In 1989 Rees was one of\nfour mathematicians from the ONR awarded the IEEE Computer Society Pioneer\nAward.\n\nMina Rees returned to Hunter College as professor of mathematics and dean of\nthe faculty in 1953 and became head of a new O\ufb03ce of Institutional Research there\nthe following year. On June 24, 1955, she married Leopold Brahdy, a physician\nwhom she had known for many years. Brahdy was born in Vienna, Austria, in\n1892 and immigrated with his family to the United States when he was six. He\nlater chaired the Metropolitan New York Section of the History of Science Society.\nBrahdy died in 1977.\n\nRees remained as professor and dean until 1961 when the City University of\nNew York was founded, and she became professor and dean of graduate studies\nat CUNY. In the latter position she was instrumental in shaping the nature of\ngraduate studies at CUNY. She was provost of the graduate division 1968\u201369 and\nwas president of the Graduate School from 1969 until her retirement as president\nemeritus in 1972. She wrote a report, \u201cThe \ufb01rst ten years of the Graduate School,\nThe City University of New York,\u201d the year she retired.\n\nRees was interested in mathematics education and wrote several articles for the\nNCTM journal Mathematics Teacher. During the 1960s she served on several advi-\nsory committees for educational projects including one formed by the Conference\nBoard of the Mathematical Sciences for a course on contemporary mathematics on\nthe NBC program Continental Classroom. She was also a member of the consultants\nbureau of the MAA Committee on the Undergraduate Program in Mathematics in\n1961 and served on the steering committee for a study of mathematics curriculum\nsupported by an NSF grant and reported on at the Cambridge Conference on School\nMathematics in 1963.\n\nStarting in the 1950s, Rees served in a number of important positions in scienti\ufb01c\norganizations. Especially noteworthy were her positions in 1964\u201370 on the National\nScience Board, to which she was appointed by President Lyndon Johnson, and\nwithin the AAAS, where she became the \ufb01rst woman president in 1971. Also in\nthe AAAS, where she was a fellow, she served as vice president 1953\u201354, chairman\nof Section A 1953\u201354, member of the board of directors 1957\u201360, and chairman of\nthe board 1972. Her positions within the ACM included her appointment to the\noriginal executive council 1947\u201348 and her election to the executive council 1948\u2013\n50. For the AMS she was on the nominating committee 1952 and was a trustee\n1955\u201359. In the MAA she was vice president 1963\u201364, was vice chairman 1955 and\nchairman 1956 of the New York Metropolitan Section, and was on or served as\nchairman of numerous committees; these included the committee on World War\nII History 1981\u201383. For SIAM she was councillor 1953\u201356, on the committee on\nvisiting lecturers 1959\u201360, representative on the AAAS council 1958\u201361, and on\nthe board of directors of the SIAM Institute for Mathematics and Society. She\nwas councillor 1957\u201360 for the New York Academy of Sciences. She also served as a\nmember of the executive committee of the American Conference of Academic Deans\n1960\u201362. She chaired a panel on the level and forms of support in the mathematical\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nREES - 4\n\nsciences for a report issued in 1968 by the Committee on Support of Research in\nthe Mathematical Sciences (COSRIMS) of the National Research Council for the\nCommittee on Science and Public Policy of the National Academy of Sciences. In\naddition to her many posts, she often chaired sessions at meetings, symposia, and\nconferences and also gave a number of banquet addresses.\n\nPublications by and about Rees are so numerous that we have not attempted to\nlist them all. Two references to Rees, the 1962 article in the Monthly and the 1987\narticle by Phyllis Fox in Women of Mathematics: A Bioblibliographic Sourcebook,\nlist several additional reports or articles by Rees that we have not included; Fox\nalso lists several references to Rees that do not appear below.\n\nAmong Rees\u2019s many honors are at least eighteen honorary degrees from US col-\nleges and universities; the King\u2019s Medal for Service in the Cause of Freedom \u201cin\nrecognition of valuable services rendered to the Allied war e\ufb00ort\u201d 1948 (Bull. Amer.\nMath. Soc. 54 (1948): 493); the President\u2019s Certi\ufb01cate of Merit 1948; MAA\u2019s \ufb01rst\naward for service to mathematics 1962; Hunter College High School\u2019s \ufb01rst distin-\nguished graduate 1965; AAUW achievement award 1965; a AAAS Symposium to\nHonor Mina Rees, January 1982; and the Public Welfare Medal, National Academy\nof Sciences, \u201cfor her contributions to the scienti\ufb01c enterprise, especially in math-\nematics, astronomy and computer science, from wartime, through the transition\nfrom war to peace, and continuing today\u201d April 25, 1983 (NAS Archives). The li-\nbrary at the Graduate School and University Center of CUNY was dedicated as\nthe Mina Rees Library in 1985. In 1970 she was also featured in Vogue magazine\nas one of nine women described as \u201cLiberated. All Liberated.\u201d\n\nRees had broad cultural interests that included music, dance, and literature. It\nwas noted in her 1985 pro\ufb01le in Mathematical People that she was \u201can accomplished\npainter . . . [who] for a time . . . studied in Mexico every year\u201d (p. 257). Later she\nwent to Maine in summers and painted there. She was a frequent traveler abroad\nand made trips to South America and Europe. She was a member of the Unitarian\nChurch of All Souls in Manhattan for many years.\n\nMina Rees died at the Mary Manning Walsh Home in Manhattan a few months\nafter her ninety-\ufb01fth birthday. She was survived by a niece, a great-niece, and\ngrand-nephews. She left $1.7 million to the CUNY Graduate Center to establish a\nfellowship and to endow a chair in mathematics. At the CUNY Graduate Center\nthe Mina Rees Dissertation Fellowships in the Sciences are awarded annually. In\naddition, at least one Mina S. Rees Graduate Scholarship in Sciences and Mathe-\nmatics is awarded annually to students in, or about to enroll in, a PhD program at\nCUNY. She is the subject of two doctoral dissertations.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, SIAM, AAAS (fellow), Phi Beta Kappa,\nSigma Xi, Pi Mu Epsilon.\n\nDissertation:\n1931 Division algebras associated with an equation whose group has four generators.\nPhD dissertation, University of Chicago, directed by Leonard Eugene Dickson.

October 22, 1901\u2013December 21, 1988.\nUniversity of California, Southern Branch (BEd 1923), University of Chicago\n(MA 1926, PhD 1928).\n\nMay Margaret Beenken was the daughter of Sophie (Kirn) (1862\u20131941), born\nin Pennsylvania, and Henry Beenken (b. 1852), born in Germany. She was born\nin Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, and had at least three older siblings: Daniel (ca.\n1886\u20131954), a sister born in 1893, and Walter (1896\u20131959).\n\nMay Beenken attended public elementary school and three years of high school\nin Philadelphia before the family moved to southern California. After one year there\nshe graduated from the Manual Arts High School of Los Angeles in 1919. She then\nwas a member of the \ufb01rst class to receive bachelor\u2019s degrees at the Southern Branch\nof the University of California (now UCLA); she received a bachelor of education\ndegree in 1923.\n\nBeenken taught in the public schools of Los Angeles 1923\u201324 and was an associate\nin mathematics at the Southern Branch of the University of California 1924\u201325. She\nentered the University of Chicago in the summer of 1925 and was in residence there,\nexcept for summer quarter 1927, until June 1928, when she received her doctorate\nwith a dissertation in projective di\ufb00erential geometry. She was a university fellow\nher last two years at Chicago and during that time served as chairman of the com-\nmittee on arrangements and of the program committee of the Junior Mathematics\nClub.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD in 1928, Beenken joined the faculty at Oshkosh Teach-\ners College (now University of Wisconsin Oshkosh) as head of the mathematics\ndepartment and remained in that position for nineteen years. She was joined in\n1929 by Irene Price. In February 1931 Beenken organized the mathematics club at\nthe college. She was in charge of mathematics for the US Air Force 96th column\ntraining detachment at the college 1943\u201344, and was director of the division of\npre-professional education from 1944 until she left in 1947.\n\nBeenken attended almost every meeting of the Wisconsin Section of the MAA\nfrom its \ufb01rst in April 1933 until she left the state in 1947; she served as secretary\nin 1934\u201335 and chairman in 1943\u201344. She was active in other state organizations\nas well; she was chairman in 1936\u201337 of the mathematics section of the Wisconsin\nEducation Association and was a member in the late 1930s of a state committee\non the uses and appreciation of mathematics.\n\nBeenken was a lecturer at UCLA in the summer of 1945, and in 1947 returned to\nsouthern California as associate professor of mathematics and department chairman\nat Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles; she was promoted to professor in 1951.\nDuring the summer of 1953 she attended an eight-week conference on collegiate\nmathematics in Boulder, Colorado, that was sponsored by the National Science\nFoundation. She received grants from the NSF for work at the University of Oregon\nin summer 1954 and at UCLA in summer 1959 and from the Social Science Research\nCouncil for work at Stanford in summer 1957. She retired from Immaculate Heart\nCollege as emeritus professor in 1969.\n\nBeenken died at age eighty-seven in 1988 at St. Vincent Medical Center in Los\nAngeles. She was buried in Holy Cross Cemetery in Culver City, California. In the\nmemorial note that appeared in the Immaculate Heart College Alumni Newsletter\nafter her death, a former student and colleague recalled that \u201cshe was indeed a\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBEENKEN - 2\n\nsuperb instructor, always prepared down to the minutest detail and utterly meticu-\nlous in her comprehensive presentations\u201d (p. 8). He added, \u201cI remember once when\nover 80% of her graduating mathematics majors were above the 90th percentile in\nthe nationwide Advanced Area Test in Mathematics \u2013 no students of Dr. Beenken\u2019s\ncould ever say that they did not receive the best instruction that any educational\ninstitution could ever o\ufb00er.\u201d And, \ufb01nally, \u201cDr. Beenken was at all times a creative\nperson, and when she retired from the College she decided to turn to painting. She\napplied herself here with the same single-mindedness as in teaching\u201d (p. 10).\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, NCTM, AAAS (fellow), AAUW, Sigma Xi,\nPi Mu Epsilon.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1926 On the projective equivalence of plane curves.

August 9, 1891\u2013March 19, 1971.\nGoucher College (BA 1913), Johns Hopkins University (MA 1922, PhD 1926).\n\nMartha Helen Barton was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of Mary\nIrene (Eichelberger) (b. 1860) and James Sheridan Barton (b. 1858), both Maryland\nnatives. She had an older brother, Alan Eichelberger (1889\u20131964), and a younger\nsister, Vola Price (1893\u20131982), also born in Maryland, presumably in Baltimore,\nwhere her family made its home. In 1900 her parents had been married eleven years.\nAt that time her father\u2019s occupation was listed as groceryman; in 1910 he was a\ncoal merchant and in 1920 a retail merchant, general store. Her brother became a\ncontractor in Baltimore, and her sister became a college physics professor.\n\nHelen Barton received her primary and secondary education in the public schools\nof Baltimore and graduated with honors from Western High School. She attended\nGoucher College (Woman\u2019s College of Baltimore until 1910) as a Western High\nSchool alumnae scholar 1909\u201311 and graduated in 1913, a member of Phi Beta\nKappa. While Barton was a student at Goucher, two faculty members there were\nawarded PhD\u2019s in mathematics at Johns Hopkins; they were Clara L. Bacon in 1911\nand Florence P. Lewis in 1913. Barton mentioned in a letter of Sept 22, 1937, to\nHelen Owens that Clara Bacon \u201dwas my beloved teacher at Goucher and has been a\nreal friend through these many years.\u201d The year after her graduation Barton served\nas an assistant in physics at Goucher and the following year, 1914\u201315, did graduate\nwork in mathematics and physics as a Goucher alumnae fellow at the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity. In 1915 her sister, Vola Price Barton, graduated from Goucher with a\nmajor in mathematics, also as a member of Phi Beta Kappa. Vola Barton earned\na master\u2019s degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1917 and immediately was hired\nat Goucher; she earned a PhD in physics from Johns Hopkins in 1923 and served\nas professor of physics and department chairman at Goucher before her retirement\nin 1958.\n\nFrom 1915 until 1919 Helen Barton served as head of the department of chemistry\nand physics at Salem College, a private college for women in Winston-Salem, North\nCarolina. The following two years she was an instructor in mathematics at Wellesley\nCollege. She continued her graduate work at Johns Hopkins during the summers\nof 1920 and 1921 and did some graduate work at Harvard University during the\nwinter of 1921 while also teaching at Wellesley. She received the master\u2019s degree in\nJune 1922 from Johns Hopkins.\n\nBarton left her position at Wellesley in 1921 and moved to Albion College in\nMichigan, where she was associate professor of mathematics and dean of women\n1921\u201325. In 1925 she resumed her full-time graduate work at Johns Hopkins and\nwas a university scholar for the year 1925\u201326. Her language requirements in French\nand German were approved in October 1925; and she passed written and oral exam-\ninations in mathematics as principal subject, physics as \ufb01rst subordinate subject,\nand applied mathematics as second subordinate subject in May 1926. In a letter\nof May 13, 1926, recommending the acceptance of her dissertation, Frank Morley\nand Francis D. Murnaghan wrote that she \u201chas considerably simpli\ufb01ed the exposi-\ntion of Grassmann\u2019s theory of extensive magnitudes by the use of [the generalized\nKronecker symbol]\u201d (Ferdinand Hamburger Archives of The Johns Hopkins Uni-\nversity, RG 13.010, O\ufb03ce of the Registrar, Subgroup 1, Series 2, [Barton, Helen]).\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBARTON - 2\n\nThe doctorate was awarded in June 1926. Barton spent the following year as pro-\nfessor and head of the department at Alabama College, then a college for women\nin Montevallo, Alabama; it is now the coeducational University of Montevallo.\n\nIn 1927 Helen Barton joined the faculty of the North Carolina College for Women\n(later Woman\u2019s College of the University of North Carolina and now the University\nof North Carolina at Greensboro), where she was to remain until her retirement.\nShe began her career there as associate professor and acting head of the department,\nand the following year, 1928, became professor and head of the department. She\nretired as professor emeritus at age sixty-eight in 1960 but continued teaching part\ntime.\n\nIn addition to teaching and chairing the mathematics department, Barton was\nactive both on campus and in various professional groups. She was president of the\nfaculty science club at Woman\u2019s College 1929\u201330 and was president of the campus\nchapter of Phi Beta Kappa. Later in her career Barton was chairman of the faculty\nplanning committee for the new McIver classroom building, and the faculty lounge\nin McIver was named in her honor in 1960. Barton was on the accrediting committee\nof AAUW and was a member of the North Carolina Education Association, serving\nas president of the mathematics section 1933\u201334. She was also an active member\nof the North Carolina Academy of Science and was vice president 1933\u201334; she was\npresident 1928\u201329 and secretary 1931\u201332 of the mathematics section; and she was\nelected a life member of the Academy in 1961.\n\nAt one point after her most active period in professional organizations but before\nher retirement, Barton described her hobbies as \u201ctravel when I can \ufb01nd time and\nmoney at the same time\u201d (University of North Carolina at Greensboro Archives).\nHer travel included a trip in the summer of 1958 to the Canadian Rockies, Glacier\nNational Park, Lake Louise, Ban\ufb00, and Jasper National Park. She was a member\nof a Methodist church in Baltimore but attended the Presbyterian Church of the\nCovenant in Greensboro.\n\nHelen Barton died at the Greensboro Convalescent Center at age seventy-nine\nafter a long illness and was buried in Baltimore, where her surviving sibling, Vola P.\nBarton, still lived. Helen Barton left $5000 to the University of North Carolina at\nGreensboro to establish the Helen Barton Mathematics Scholarship Fund.

      "text": "MONTAGUE, Harriet F. June 9, 1905\u2013March 19, 1997.\nUniversity of Buffalo (BS 1927, MA 1929), Cornell University (PhD 1935).\n\nHarriet Frances Montague, born in Bu\ufb00alo, New York, was the younger of two\nchildren of Alice Barbara (Ha\ufb00a) (1880\u20131942) and Laurence Hibbard Montague\n(1881\u20131950), both natives of Bu\ufb00alo. Her mother had a high school education and\nlater was a cashier in retail stores and a homemaker; her father had an elementary\nand private musical education and was an organist, choirmaster, and composer. Her\nparents married in about 1902; their \ufb01rst child, Ainslie B. Montague, was born in\n1904 and died in 1921.\n\nHarriet Montague attended Lafayette High School in Bu\ufb00alo before entering\nthe University of Bu\ufb00alo, where she spent many years as a student, and all of\nher career as a faculty member. (The University of Bu\ufb00alo, originally private, was\nincorporated into the state system in 1962 and has since been the State University\nof New York at Bu\ufb00alo.) Montague received her undergraduate degree from the\nUniversity of Bu\ufb00alo magna cum laude in 1927 in the Honors Division. She stayed\nat the university as a graduate assistant in mathematics 1927\u201329 and received her\nmaster\u2019s degree in 1929. She was then appointed instructor in the department and\napparently continued some graduate work in mathematics while also teaching.\n\nIn December 1933 Montague applied for admission to Cornell University for the\nsummer of 1934. She was admitted and studied informally with Virgil Snyder that\nsummer and continued her formal course work in the academic year 1934\u201335. It was\nrecommended that she be given four terms residence credits for her graduate work\nat Bu\ufb00alo. A memo of February 1935 indicates that Montague was admitted to\nCornell without \ufb01nancial support because she was unknown to any member of the\ndepartment. However, reports from her Cornell professors were highly favorable, and\nshe was recommended for a tuition scholarship for spring 1935. Virgil Snyder, her\ndissertation advisor, wrote that he had all the scholars and fellows in the department\nin his course and that Miss Montague was as good as any member of the class.\nHaving completed her dissertation in geometry, Montague received her PhD in\nJune 1935 with minors in algebra and logic.\n\nAfter receiving her doctorate, Montague returned to the University of Bu\ufb00alo\nand served there as instructor 1929\u201339, assistant professor 1939\u201344, associate pro-\nfessor 1944\u201347, and professor 1947\u201373. She was acting chairman of the mathematics\ndepartment during the \ufb01rst semester 1945\u201346 and in the academic years 1962\u201365,\nand was director of undergraduate studies 1970\u201373. From 1967 she was also profes-\nsor of education. She retired as professor emeritus in 1973. In her 1981 Smithsonian\nquestionnaire she mentioned both Harry M. Gehman, her department head at Buf-\nfalo 1929\u201362, and Mabel D. Montgomery, \u201cformer student, co-author, friend,\u201d as\nclose associates with whom she had had signi\ufb01cant mathematical contact.\n\nMontague contributed to the department and university in many ways. During\nthe 1930s and 1940s she was often faculty advisor to the University of Bu\ufb00alo mathe-\nmatics club. Her curriculum vitae from 1976 lists mainly her most recent activities.\nShe details her departmental committee memberships for 1972\u201373 as chairman,\nBuilding Committee; chairman, Advisory Committee for Undergraduate Studies;\nMathematics\u2013Education Committee; and Ad Hoc Committee on Course Renum-\nbering; she notes that other departmental duties in the past are too numerous to\nreconstruct. School and faculty positions included coordinator for the mathematics\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMONTAGUE - 2\n\nsection of the Western New York Science Forum, former member of the Executive\nCommittees of the College of Arts and Sciences and the Millard Fillmore College\n(the evening division), and former member of the Student A\ufb00airs Committee of the\nfaculty senate. University activities for 1971\u201373 included serving as a member of\nthe President\u2019s Committee on the Recruitment and Promotion of Women Faculty\nand Sta\ufb00 and serving as treasurer of the Faculty Club.\n\nMontague taught both undergraduate and graduate courses, primarily in alge-\nbra, geometry, and mathematics education and was often faculty advisor to the\nmathematics club. She directed one mathematics PhD dissertation, that of Samuel\nT. Stern in logic in 1962. She also directed seven dissertations for EdD degrees that\nwere awarded between 1969 and 1972. Already in 1953 her concern with mathe-\nmatics education was evident when she organized the Inter-School Math Society\nfor gifted high school students in six Bu\ufb00alo area schools. According to her 1976\nvita, \u201cthe selected group of students and their teachers met monthly on a voluntary\nbasis to study topics in mathematics not in the normal curriculum. This activity\npredated the impetus generated by Sputnik to recognize and develop the abilities of\ngifted students in science and mathematics\u201d (Smithsonian questionnaire 1981). The\ngroups met for several years until the National Science Foundation established pro-\ngrams with similar goals. Montague was director of various NSF summer institutes\nfor secondary teachers from 1957 until 1970. Her 1963 textbook for non-science stu-\ndents, The Signi\ufb01cance of Mathematics, was coauthored with her colleague Mabel\nD. Montgomery, who had received a PhD in mathematics from the University of\nBu\ufb00alo in 1953, the second year such a degree was awarded there.\n\nMontague was active in mathematics and mathematics education organizations.\nShe was particularly involved with the Upper New York State Section (now the\nSeaway Section) of the MAA. She was one of the original founders in 1940, served\nas vice chairman 1952\u201353, chairman 1953\u201354, and governor 1961\u201364. In addition,\nshe served on the MAA nominating committee for 1965 and was a life member of the\nassociation. She was also a member of the International Phenomenological Society\nand of Pi Lambda Theta, an honor and professional association in education, and\nwas a member of the council, and later historian (1974\u201379), of the Association of\nMathematics Teachers of New York State. She had been a member of the AMS\nfor sixty-seven years at the time of her death. Montague was active in professional\nactivities outside of mathematics, especially in Bu\ufb00alo chapters of the AAUP and\nthe AAUW. She served as secretary and as president of the local branch of the\nAAUP and as treasurer of the Bu\ufb00alo AAUW (1937\u201339). In 1966 the Bu\ufb00alo branch\nof the AAUW presented her with its Achievement Award and gave her a lifetime\nmembership in the organization.\n\nHarriet Montague was an active Presbyterian with an involvement in church\nactivities at the local, regional, and national levels. In the 1960s she was chairman\nof the department of campus ministry for the Council of Churches. She was a ruling\nelder of the United Presbyterian Church USA beginning in 1957 and was the \ufb01rst\nwoman to serve as vice-moderator (1963) and moderator (1964) of the Presbytery\nof Western New York. She was a member of the Board of Directors of Auburn\nTheological Seminary in New York City for several years beginning in 1969, was on\nthe national Board of Christian Education 1965\u201372 (vice president 1969\u201372) of the\nUnited Presbyterian Church USA, and was a member of the National Commission\nfor United Ministries in Higher Education 1968\u201372.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMONTAGUE - 3\n\nIn the late 1930s Montague wrote that she was a member of Theta Chi (a social\nfraternity) and Cap and Gown, and described herself as a Republican. She men-\ntioned music and sports as hobbies. In 1981 she mentioned watercolor painting,\ngardening, and volunteer work at the Bu\ufb00alo Zoo, where she was a docent. Non-\nprofessional memberships at that time were the Bu\ufb00alo Zoological Society, where\nshe was since 1975 on the board of directors; the Bu\ufb00alo Museum of Science; and the\nBu\ufb00alo Historical Society. Other local memberships in 1976 included the YWCA\nand the Allentown Association, a neighborhood organization.\n\nIn 1972 the State University Alumni Association presented Montague with its\nDistinguished Alumni Award. She was given citations at the 50th anniversary of\nthe College of Arts and Sciences at the University of Bu\ufb00alo and at the 125th\nanniversary of the founding of the university. The Harriet F. Montague Award was\nestablished at the time of her retirement in 1973. It is presented to an undergraduate\nmathematics major after the completion of his or her junior year, and is awarded\non the basis of intellectual and creative promise in mathematics.\n\nAfter a long illness, Montague died in 1997 at age ninety-one in her Bu\ufb00alo home,\nwhich she shared with Mabel D. Montgomery, her only listed survivor. A memorial\nservice was held in First Presbyterian Church, Symphony Circle; she is buried in\nForest Lawn Cemetery in Bu\ufb00alo.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, NCTM, AAUW, AAUP, Phi Beta Kappa,\nSigma Xi, Pi Mu Epsilon.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1929 A detailed study of the directrices of a linear congruence.

      "text": "STOKES, Ruth W. October 12, 1890\u2013August 27, 1968.\nWinthrop Normal and Industrial College of South Carolina (BA 1911), Van-\nderbilt University (MA 1923), Duke University (PhD 1931).\n\nRuth Wyckli\ufb00e Stokes was born in Greenville, South Carolina, the youngest of six\nchildren of Frances Emily (Fuller) (1857\u20131915) and William Henry Stokes (b. 1850),\nnatives of South Carolina who married in 1879. In the 1880 census her father was\nlisted as an MD and a farmer; in 1900 he was listed as a farmer. Her older siblings\nwere John T. (1880\u20131963), Marie V. (1881\u20131957), Franklin F. (1883\u20131943), Sara\nF. (1885\u20131977), and Clarence E. (1887\u20131941). In 1910, \ufb01ve of the adult children\nwere living at home with their widowed mother in Mountville, South Carolina. No\noccupation was given for the nineteen-year-old Ruth, her sister Marie was a public\nschool teacher, two brothers were farmers, and one was at school. Although there is\ncon\ufb02icting information about the birth year for Ruth Stokes, census records indicate\nthat 1890 is the most likely date.\n\nStokes attended Winthrop Normal and Industrial College of South Carolina (af-\nter 1920, Winthrop College, the South Carolina College for Women; now Winthrop\nUniversity), then a women\u2019s college in Rock Hill, South Carolina, for four years and\ngraduated in 1911. She had six teaching positions during the next dozen years. In\n1911\u201312 she taught in grade school in Denmark, South Carolina; the next year she\ntaught high school mathematics, English, and French in the same town; in 1913\u201316\nshe was principal of the Ebenezer Graded School in Rock Hill, South Carolina; the\nfollowing year she was head of the mathematics department at Synodical College\nin Fulton, Missouri; in 1917\u201320 she taught high school mathematics and English in\nSpartanburg, South Carolina; and in 1920\u201322 she taught high school mathematics\nin Greenville, South Carolina.\n\nAccording to material in the Winthrop University Archives, Stokes indicated\nin January 1922 that she had received certi\ufb01cates in mathematics and English\nfor work done at Columbia University (six weeks), the University of Virginia (six\nweeks), and the University of Chicago (six weeks). She also did correspondence\nwork at the University of Chicago. Stokes held a fellowship at Vanderbilt 1922\u201323\nand received her master\u2019s degree in 1923. She spent the next \ufb01ve years as assistant\nprofessor in a four-person mathematics department at Winthrop College. During\nthe summers of 1926, 1927, and 1928 she attended summer school at the University\nof Wisconsin.\n\nIn the autumn of 1928 Stokes enrolled at Duke University, where she was a\ngraduate student and an assistant 1928\u201331. She received her PhD, the \ufb01rst awarded\nin mathematics by Duke, in 1931. Apparently at the time of her departure for Duke\nfor her doctoral work, Stokes felt that she had a private understanding with the\npresident of Winthrop that she would return to her position there after receiving\nher degree. However, he died in 1928, and his replacement was not aware of such an\nunderstanding. Thus, after Stokes received her degree in 1931, she did not return to\nWinthrop but instead remained at Duke as an instructor 1931\u201332. In 1931 Stokes\npublished her dissertation in the Transactions of the AMS. Her dissertation results\nwere discussed in some detail in \u201cDi\ufb00erent motivations and goals in the historical\ndevelopment of the theory of systems of linear inequalities\u201d by Tinne Ho\ufb00 Kjeldsen\n(Arch. Hist. Exact Sci. 56 (2002): 469\u2013538). He noted, \u201cThe innovative element in\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSTOKES, R. W. - 2\n\nStokes\u2019 contribution to the literature she is building on is the method she invoked\nin developing the theory and the numerical solution method she derived\u201d (p. 510).\nThe next three years, 1932\u201335, Stokes was an associate professor at North Texas\nState Teachers College (now North Texas State University) in Denton. The fol-\nlowing year she was professor and head of the department at Mitchell College in\nStatesville, North Carolina. She also taught in the summer of 1936 at the Asheville\nNormal and Teachers College in North Carolina. In the fall of 1936 Stokes returned\nto Winthrop College, where she remained for most of the next ten years as profes-\nsor of astronomy and mathematics and as department head. While there she was\nactive in a number of professional organizations and, in 1940, was a member of\nthe Solar Eclipse Expedition to St. Augustine, Florida. During the summer of 1941\nStokes attended the summer session at Brown University for advanced instruction\nand research in mechanics. At some point in the period 1942 through 1946, dur-\ning and after World War II, she was an instructor of military cryptography and\ncryptanalysis.\n\nIn the 1940s Stokes had disputes with the administration at Winthrop, partly\nover issues of funding for the mathematics department. These resulted in her leaving\nin 1946, when she joined the faculty at Syracuse University as assistant professor.\nNancy Cole became a colleague a year later. Stokes remained at Syracuse the rest\nof her career. She held a dual position in mathematics and education in 1947\u201348\nand was promoted to associate professor in 1953. Stokes was granted a year\u2019s leave\nof absence in 1956\u201357 to accept a visiting professorship at the American University\nin Beirut. She returned home in December 1956 to be with her sister, Marie V.\nStokes, who was at that time in the Greenville, South Carolina, hospital. Marie\nStokes died the following August. Ruth Stokes retired from Syracuse as associate\nprofessor emeritus in June 1959 after which she was associate professor, 1959\u201360,\nat Longwood College (now Longwood University) in Farmville, Virginia.\n\nStokes was always professionally active. In the early 1940s she was vice-chairman\nand then chairman of the Southeastern Section of the MAA, and she was president\nof the mathematics section of the South Carolina Education Association. She was a\nmember of the board of directors of NCTM 1944\u201347 and was a member of their com-\nmittee on visual aids. Stokes was particularly interested in mathematical models;\nshe gave a number of talks on this subject in the 1940s and exhibited a collection\nof models at the International Congress of Mathematicians at Cambridge, Mas-\nsachusetts, in 1950. While she was at Syracuse she was the \ufb01rst editor-in-chief of\nthe Pi Mu Epsilon Journal , whose \ufb01rst issue was November 1949 and whose par-\nent organization was founded at Syracuse in 1914. She belonged to the New York\nAcademy of Sciences, the South Carolina Academy of Science, and the Astronomical\nSociety of the Paci\ufb01c.\n\nStokes was also a member of Pi Lambda Theta, an honorary and professional\nassociation in education; Chi Delta Phi, an honorary literary society; and Sigma\nKappa, a social sorority. Around 1940 she described herself as a Methodist and a\nDemocrat with art (oil paintings, \ufb02orals, landscapes) as a hobby and golf as her\nfavorite recreation.\n\nAfter her retirement, Stokes moved to her family home in Mountville, South\nCarolina. She died at age seventy-seven in the hospital in nearby Clinton in 1968\nand was buried in the Mountville Cemetery. An obituary noted that she was a\nmember of the Mountville Presbyterian church, the Daughters of the American\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSTOKES, R. W. - 3\n\nRevolution, and the National League of American Pen Women. She was survived\nby one sister, Sara S.

December 22, 1881\u2013August 30, 1969.\nWellesley College (BA 1904), Yale University (PhD 1908).\n\nEuphemia Richardson Worthington was born in Troy, New York, the \ufb01rst of three\ndaughters of Sophia Adelaide (Whidden) (1851\u20131895) and John Worthington (1840\u20131913).\nHer mother was born in Nova Scotia and was boarding in Troy with Harriet Richardson and\nRichardson\u2019s brother in June 1880 before her marriage to the widowed John Worthington\nin December that year. Her father was born in New York State, had three children by his\nprevious marriage, and was a coal dealer. Her sisters were Jennie Adelaide (1883\u20131888)\nand Dorothy (b. 1887). Harriet Richardson was living with the Worthington family in\n1900.\n\nEuphemia Worthington attended the Emma Willard School in Troy 1895\u20131900. She\nthen entered Wellesley College, where she was known as E\ufb03e. Her mathematics courses at\nWellesley included elementary and college algebra; theory of equations and determinants;\nplane, solid, plane analytic, solid analytic, modern synthetic, and projective geometry;\ncalculus; and astronomy. She graduated in 1904.\n\nWorthington entered Yale University in 1905 and wrote her dissertation under the\ndirection of James Pierpont. After receiving her PhD in 1908, Worthington taught for a\nyear at the Emma Willard School. From 1909 to 1918 she was an instructor at Wellesley,\nher undergraduate alma mater. She was one of seven Wellesley faculty who were listed as\ncharter members of the MAA in 1916. In 1918 she left Wellesley to do war work during\nWorld War I. She was assistant to the chief engineer of the Gallaudet Aircraft Corporation\nin East Greenwich, Rhode Island, from July 1918 to May 1919. She reported for the 1919\nissue of the Wellesley Class of 1904 Record Book: \u201cThis summer I have been working for an\naircraft company near Providence and am \ufb01nding my work, which is doing mathematical\nwork for the chief engineer, very interesting and very far from monotonous, a decided\nchange from teaching freshmen\u201d (Wellesley College Archives). In May 1919 Worthington\nalso took, and passed, the \ufb01rst part of the associate examination of the Actuarial Society\nof America (ASA). Later in 1919 she was unemployed and living in Pasadena, California.\nShe resumed her position at the Gallaudet Aircraft Corporation and worked there again\nfrom March 1920 to January 1922. In May 1920 she passed the second part of the ASA\nassociate examination and apparently never attempted the remaining two parts.\n\nIn January 1922 Worthington was appointed instructor in mathematics at the Southern\nBranch of the University of California. This former state normal school conferred its \ufb01rst\nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1923 and changed its name to the University of California at Los\nAngeles in 1927. From about that time until her retirement at age sixty-seven, Worthington\nregularly attended meetings of the Southern California Section of the MAA and regional\nmeetings of the AMS held in southern California. Worthington became assistant professor\nin 1925 and retired as assistant professor emeritus in 1949. She had leaves with two-thirds\nsalary from March 25 to June 30 in 1929 and from January 1 to June 30 in 1932. She\nworked as a stress analyst in the engineering department of the Bell Aircraft Company in\nBu\ufb00alo, New York, in summer 1942. She was also designated an emeritus fellow by UCLA\nin 1954.\n\nFor some years after her retirement, Worthington spent summers in Carmel, California,\nand winters in Victoria, British Columbia, before eventually moving permanently to Vic-\ntoria.

      "text": "MILLER, Bessie Irving. November 4, 1884\u2013February 4, 1931.\nWoman\u2019s College of Baltimore (BA 1907), Johns Hopkins University (PhD\n1914).\n\nBessie Irving Miller was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the only child of Bessie\n(Knotts) (1864\u20131914) and Irving Miller (1858\u20131946), both natives of Maryland,\nwho married in 1882. Her father was a surgeon, and in 1900 the household on St.\nPaul Street in Baltimore included four boarders, a cook, two house maids, and two\ntrained nurses in addition to the three family members.\n\nMiller attended the Girls Latin School, the preparatory department for the\nWoman\u2019s College of Baltimore (Goucher College after 1910), which she then at-\ntended and from which she graduated in 1907. According to Cockey\u2019s \u201cMathemat-\nics at Goucher,\u201d \u201cmathematics was her second choice of interest, chosen when she\nrealized that poor eyesight would make it impossible for her to become a surgeon\n. . . \u201d (p. 11). In 1903\u201307, while Miller was a student at Woman\u2019s College of Bal-\ntimore, the mathematics department there consisted of William H. Maltbie, who\nhad earned his PhD from Johns Hopkins in 1895, and Clara Latimer Bacon, who\nhad earned an MA from the University of Chicago in 1904.\n\nIn 1907\u201308, the year following her graduation from college, Miller was a graduate\nstudent in mathematics and physics at the University of Chicago with a fellowship\nsponsored by the Woman\u2019s College of Baltimore. In October 1908 she entered the\nJohns Hopkins University as a graduate student in mathematics, astronomy, and\nclassical archaeology. This was just a year after Bacon, her college mathematics\ninstructor, entered Johns Hopkins when the trustees voted to allow women to be\nadmitted to graduate courses without special permission.\n\nIn 1911 Miller interrupted her graduate studies to become an instructor of math-\nematics at Kemper Hall in Kenosha, Wisconsin. Kemper Hall, closed in 1975, was\nan Episcopal school for girls that had preparatory and collegiate departments when\nMiller was there. Two years later she returned to Johns Hopkins and \ufb01nished her\ndoctoral work as a university fellow during the year 1913\u201314. The notes she took\nher \ufb01nal year for a course on groups taught by Arthur B. Coble, together with\nher own writings on elliptic functions, are preserved as the Bessie Irving Miller\nPapers at Johns Hopkins. Miller passed written exams in mathematics, astronomy,\nand classical archaeology and art, and wrote her dissertation in algebraic geometry\nunder the direction of Coble, who was an early student of Frank Morley at Johns\nHopkins. Miller was one of Coble\u2019s \ufb01rst two doctoral students. The letter of May 30,\n1914, by Morley and Coble recommending the acceptance of her dissertation notes,\n\u201cShe applies e\ufb00ectively geometrical methods to an analytical problem, and obtains\nresults both novel and interesting. The style is good and gives clear evidence of a\nwell-balanced and mature mind\u201d (Student folders, Ferdinand Hamburger Univer-\nsity Archives, Johns Hopkins University). When Miller received her doctorate from\nJohns Hopkins in 1914, she became the \ufb01rst of ten Goucher graduates to obtain a\nPhD in mathematics before 1940; seven of these were granted by Johns Hopkins.\nBacon had become the \ufb01rst woman to receive a PhD in mathematics from Johns\nHopkins in 1911. Miller remained at Johns Hopkins the year after receiving her\ndoctorate and was later described as a research worker that year.\n\nIn 1915 Miller became head of the mathematics and physics departments at\nRockford College in Illinois, where she was to remain for thirteen years. Rockford\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMILLER - 2\n\nCollege, originally a female seminary, granted its \ufb01rst degree (baccalaureate) in\n1882 and remained a women\u2019s college until 1958. Institutional changes in titles and\ndepartment structures over the years resulted in Miller\u2019s later being professor of\nmathematics and physics and then professor of mathematics. During her tenure\nat Rockford, her primary department\u2019s name was mathematics, then mathematics\nand physics, and \ufb01nally mathematics and astronomy. Through all these changes\nMiller was usually the professor teaching the majority of the mathematics, physics,\nand astronomy courses. By 1920 she was the most senior faculty member at the\ncollege. For the year 1919\u201320 she was joined by associate professor Jessie M. Jacobs\n(O\ufb00ermann), who had just earned her PhD at the University of Illinois. Jacobs was\nalso a student of Arthur B. Coble, who had moved to the University of Illinois in\n1918 from Johns Hopkins. Jacobs remained one year at Rockford before moving to\nthe University of Texas as instructor of pure mathematics.\n\nIn addition to her regular teaching and administrative duties at Rockford, Miller\nremained intellectually active in broader areas. She again studied at the University\nof Chicago during the summer of 1920. During her years at Rockford, she greatly\nexpanded and broadened the course o\ufb00erings in mathematics and science. She in-\ntroduced courses in di\ufb00erential equations, history of mathematics, mathematical\ndrawing, statistics, projective geometry, applications of mathematics, philosophy of\nmathematics, and theory of investments, as well as courses for teachers of mathe-\nmatics. At Rockford she introduced an elective course that covered a broad range of\ntopics in mathematics and science. Her 1924 book Romance in Science was based\non lectures developed for this course. Similar talks, with titles \u201cThe Fourth Di-\nmension\u201d and \u201cThe Einstein Theory\u201d had also been given by Miller at meetings\nof a student mathematics club that was begun two years after Miller\u2019s arrival at\nRockford.\n\nWhile Miller was at Rockford, she was especially active in the MAA. She was\na charter member of the MAA and was elected secretary of the Illinois Section\nin May 1924. The following three years she was secretary-treasurer of the section.\nIn addition to talks she presented at MAA meetings, her interest in mathematics\neducation was evident in her participation in the section meetings, where she was\na discussant for talks given in 1919 on the training of mathematics teachers and in\n1926 on undergraduate mathematics courses in geometry.\n\nMiller had a leave of absence from Rockford College in the spring term 1927\u2013\n28. She then took a position as instructor at the University of Illinois in 1928. It\nis unclear what prompted her move to Illinois after that leave. It is possible that\nshe was encouraged to come by Arthur B. Coble, her dissertation advisor, who\nhad spent 1927\u201328 back at Johns Hopkins before returning to Illinois. It is likely\nthat Miller had contact with Coble that year since in May 1928 she gave a talk\nto the Maryland-District of Columbia-Virginia Section of the MAA. At Illinois,\nshe directed the master\u2019s thesis of Josephine Chanler and possibly others. She also\npublished another research paper in her \ufb01eld, the \ufb01rst since her earlier work based\non her dissertation. In addition to her work in the mathematics department at\nIllinois, Miller was involved in vocational guidance for women for the Woman\u2019s\nLeague, a University of Illinois organization for female students.\n\nMiller played violin, attended movies, theater productions, and the symphony\n(Cockey, 11). She was an Episcopalian. Miller\u2019s eyesight became increasingly bad\nduring the 1920s, and she frequently used a scribe for her correspondence.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMILLER - 3\n\nBessie Irving Miller died at age forty-six on February 4, 1931, in Burnham Hos-\npital in Champaign as the result of a \u201cstrepticoccic [sic] infection of the throat and\nmucous surfaces of head: nose ears etc\u201d (Illinois death certi\ufb01cate). She had become\nill a few days earlier, and an operation to open the ear drums was performed on\nFebruary 3. Before her death she was living with Echo D. Pepper, a colleague at\nIllinois.

      "text": "HASEMAN, Mary Gertrude. March 6, 1889\u2013April 9, 1979.\nIndiana University (BA 1910), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1917).\n\nMary Gertrude Haseman, was born in or near Linton, Indiana, the seventh of\nnine children of Elizabeth Christine (Schultze) (1853\u20131929) and John Dieterich (also\nDiedrich, Diederich) Haseman (1847\u20131924), both born near Linton. Her siblings\nwere Joseph H. (1876\u20131972); William Peter (1878\u20131932); Charles (1880\u20131931); John\nD. Jr. (1882\u20131969); Leonard (1884\u20131969); Oscar (1886\u20131967); Bertha (1891\u20131970);\nand Arthur (1895\u20131969). All nine children from this farm family in central Indiana\nwere college educated, and \ufb01ve of them earned doctorates. Gertrude Haseman\u2019s\nsix older brothers all received bachelor\u2019s degrees from Indiana University; \ufb01ve also\nearned master\u2019s degrees from Indiana. Four of the six earned PhD\u2019s: William Peter\nfrom the University of Pennsylvania in physics in 1907, Charles from G\u00a8ottingen in\nmathematics in 1907, Leonard from Cornell in entomology in 1910, and John from\nColumbia in zoology in 1911. Her younger brother and sister both earned master\u2019s\ndegrees.\n\nGertrude Haseman attended high school in Linton, where her oldest brother was\nsuperintendent of schools. She entered Indiana University in 1907 and graduated\ncum laude in mathematics in 1910. Cora Hennel and Gertrude McCain were fellow\nstudents at Indiana; Hennel was a graduate student the entire time Haseman was\nan undergraduate, while McCain was a senior 1907\u201308 and returned for a short\nperiod in 1909 as a graduate student. Haseman \ufb01rst took a position as professor\nof mathematics at Vincennes University, then a two-year college in southwestern\nIndiana, for the year 1910\u201311.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1915 Haseman was a graduate student at Bryn Mawr College:\nas a graduate scholar in mathematics 1911\u201312 and as a resident fellow 1913\u20131915.\nShe worked as a tutor in the Bryn Mawr Tutoring School from 1912 to 1915.\nDuring her \ufb01rst year at Bryn Mawr, she gave presentations to the journal club on\nprojective groups in three dimensions and on a method of successive approximations\nor iteration; her fellow graduate student presenters that year were Gertrude I.\nMcCain and Eula A. Weeks (King). In 1913\u201314 she reported on two papers by A.\nKneser in algebraic geometry. She attended lectures of Frank Morley, and probably\nalso Arthur Coble, at the Johns Hopkins University during 1915\u201317, while she also\ntaught at the Roland Park Country School in Baltimore. She wrote her dissertation\nunder the direction of Charlotte A. Scott and passed her \ufb01nal examination in May\n1916. Although her doctorate was not awarded by Bryn Mawr until 1917, her name\nwas submitted to School and Society for their \u201clist of American doctorates conferred\nduring the academic year 1915\u20131916\u201d and appears on the list of doctorates in\nmathematics published in the Bulletin of the AMS (23 (1917): 197). Haseman noted\nin her dissertation vita that at Bryn Mawr she also studied under the direction of\nJ. R. Conner in mathematics and W. B. Hu\ufb00 in physics, the subject in which she\nminored.\n\nThe results of Haseman\u2019s dissertation have appeared in books and papers in\nknot theory, especially since the mid-1980s. In a 1988 review in the Bulletin of the\nAMS of two such books, Joan Birman noted that T. P. Kirkman, C. N. Little, and\nHaseman \u201cassembled the \ufb01rst tables of knots, which have been used ever since,\nand can be seen, modulo surprisingly few corrections, at the end of both of the\nbooks under review. . . . Empirical data is of course at the heart of any subject,\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHASEMAN - 2\n\nand so this set of painfully assembled data has had an enormous impact on the\nsubject\u201d (19:552). In an essay in The History and Science of Knots, Pieter van der\nGriend describes her work as a \u201cbrave expedition into the then uncharted regions\nof 12-crossing knot-projections\u201d and calls her dissertation \u201ccharming\u201d (1995, 223).\nIn 1917\u201318 Haseman taught at the Harcum School in Bryn Mawr and during\n1918\u201319 at the high school in Linton, Indiana. She joined the University of Illi-\nnois faculty as instructor in 1920. While there she studied during two summers in\nthe early 1920s at the University of Chicago, hearing lectures of E. J. Wilczynski\nand E. H. Moore. While she was at Illinois, Haseman and a colleague, Josephine\nBurns Glasgow, spoke at an MAA meeting about preparing students to take calculus\nwho had minimal mathematics in high school. They also produced a mimeographed\nmathematics text, Freshman Mathematics: Book 1, which is in the library at South-\nern Illinois University Edwardsville. Haseman spoke at another MAA meeting about\ncurve tracing and wrote a paper on that subject, a copy of which is in the University\nof Illinois mathematics library; the paper is based on a course of lectures given at\nBryn Mawr by Charlotte Scott. In 1925 and 1926 Haseman served as second vice\npresident of Sigma Delta Epsilon, the graduate women\u2019s scienti\ufb01c fraternity.\n\nHaseman resigned her position at Illinois on October 28, 1927, and left on Jan-\nuary 31, 1928. February 1 was the opening day for the new Junior College of Con-\nnecticut (now the University of Bridgeport), and Haseman had been hired as its\n\ufb01rst professor of mathematics. She was there brie\ufb02y before serving as professor of\nmathematics and advisor of women at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York,\nduring the academic year 1928\u201329. She left after that year, with evidence suggest-\ning a dispute with the college administration. The April 1929 issue of the student\nnewspaper, Hilltops of Hartwick , contained the dedication, \u201cTo Dr. Mary Gertrude\nHaseman who, by her unfailing patience and encouragement has endeared herself\nto both students and faculty of Hartwick College.\u201d She was replaced at Hartwick\nby Roxanna Vivian.\n\nAfter leaving Hartwick, Gertrude Haseman spent some time with her brother,\nLeonard Haseman, who was then head of the department of entomology at the\nUniversity of Missouri in Columbia. A nephew reported that she held a teaching\njob in the south before returning in the summer of 1936 to live in her former home\nin Linton, where she remained until about the last year of her life. Some of the\ntime one of her brothers was there; later she lived alone and was cared for by two\nnephews.\n\nIn a conversation with one of the authors in 1986, a nephew said Haseman played\npiano and harp and was very musical. He said she was interested in lawn work and\nthat she gardened, canned, and was a good cook. Never in the hospital before her\n\ufb01nal illness, she spent about the last year of her life in a nursing home before her\ndeath at age ninety at Greene County General Hospital in Linton. Her siblings\npredeceased her, and her only survivors were nieces and nephews. She is buried,\nalong with several family members, in Memory Hill Cemetery in Linton.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Sigma Delta Epsilon, Sigma Xi.\n\nDissertation:\n1916 On knots with a census of the amphicheirals with twelve crossings.

December 30, 1904\u2013June 5, 1981.\nShurtleff College (BS 1926), University of Illinois (MA 1929, PhD 1934).\n\nHenrietta Pearl Terry was born in Virden, Illinois, the seventh of eight surviving\nchildren of nine born to Mary Etta (Kirwin) (b. 1867) and Herman R. Terry (b.\n1863), both natives of Illinois. According to the census reports of both 1900 and\n1910, Herman Terry was a farmer living in central Illinois. By 1920 the family had\nmoved to the Alton area, near the Mississippi River, and no occupation was listed\nfor Herman. Henrietta Terry\u2019s siblings were Vincent Kirwin (1890\u20131970), Carl (b.\n1892), Albert (b. 1894), Mabel (b. 1896), Clyde Norton (b. 1897), Russell (b. ca.\n1903), and Charles Everly (1908\u20131992).\n\nHenrietta Terry graduated from Alton Community High School in Alton, Illi-\nnois, in 1922 and attended the local Shurtle\ufb00 College, a Baptist college that closed\nand was later absorbed by Southern Illinois University at Edwardsville. After she\nreceived her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1926 with a major in mathematics, she taught for\ntwo years in the high school in Patterson, Illinois. She then did a year of graduate\nwork at the University of Illinois, received her master\u2019s degree in 1929, and taught\nat Muscatine Junior College (now Muscatine Community College) in Iowa for the\n\ufb01rst two years after the college was established.\n\nIn 1931 Terry returned to the University of Illinois for further graduate study.\nHer dissertation in the theory of \ufb01nite groups was directed by H. R. Brahana,\nwho had come to the department at Illinois immediately after receiving his PhD\nfrom Princeton in 1920. Although the abstract of her dissertation was accepted for\npublication in the American Journal of Mathematics, it was transferred to the Duke\nJournal of Mathematics and appeared in the \ufb01rst issue of that journal. After Terry\nreceived her doctorate in 1934 with a minor in chemistry, she taught for one year\nat the American College for Girls in Turkey. Upon her return she was an instructor\nin mathematics at the University of Illinois High School, Urbana. She was elected\nto membership in the AMS her \ufb01rst year on the faculty there. She remained at the\nuniversity high school until she took a leave for war service in 1942. She enlisted\nin the WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service), the Women\u2019s\nReserve of the US Naval Reserve, did her basic training at Smith College, trained\nin weather forecasting at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, and served at\nthe Norfolk Naval Air Station in Virginia, where she was an aerologist stationed\nin the weather bureau there. She accompanied \ufb02ight crews and was also trained to\n\ufb02y. She became a lieutenant (jg) and later a full lieutenant before her discharge on\nDecember 1, 1945.\n\nOn December 22, 1945, Henrietta Terry married Raymond Moore Nee, an engi-\nneer. Born in Portsmouth, Virginia, in 1903, Raymond Nee received a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree from Lynchburg College, a master\u2019s degree from Virginia Polytechnic In-\nstitute, and a certi\ufb01cate in electrical engineering from Lowell Institute. He held\nvarious positions with American Cyanamid Company in Wayne, New Jersey, and\nworked as a private consultant after his retirement.\n\nThe Nees had a daughter, Rayetta Terry, born in 1948. Late in 1951 they had a\nhouse built in Upper Nyack, a village on the Hudson River in southern New York\nState. Except for the year 1955\u201356, when they lived in Argentina, they lived in that\nhouse until after Henrietta Nee\u2019s death. Henrietta Nee, who used the name Terry\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nNEE - 2\n\nNee, was described by her daughter as athletic; she was interested in horseback\nriding as a girl and played tennis during her high school years. Later she was active\nin a number of local community groups. They included AAUW (for which she was\npresident), the League of Women Voters, PTA, the Nyack Garden Club, and the\nNyack Morning Music Club. She was also a board trustee of the Nyack Library and\nwas involved with the Nyack Hospital thrift shop. She played piano and enjoyed\ngoing to concerts and plays.\n\nTheir daughter, Rayetta Nee, graduated as a mathematics major from Bryn\nMawr College in 1969, studied mathematics for a year at Oxford University, and\nwas a tax attorney in New York City after studying at the Harvard Law School\nand receiving an LLM in 1974 from the NYU School of Law.\n\nH. Terry Nee died at age seventy-six in the Nyack Hospital in 1981 after a lengthy\nillness. She was survived by her husband, her daughter, four brothers, and several\nnieces and nephews, and was buried at Forest Lawn Cemetery in Norfolk, Virginia.\nIn lieu of \ufb02owers, contributions were asked for the Nyack Library, Nyack Hospital, or\nother charity.

March 29, 1899\u2013October 27, 1974.\nConcordia College (BA 1921), University of Chicago (MS 1926, PhD 1936).\n\nRuth Beatrice Rasmusen was born in Moorhead, Minnesota, the \ufb01rst child of\nOline (Steen), born in 1876 in Norway, and Robert Rasmusen, born in 1866 in\nMinnesota. Her mother had immigrated to the United States in 1892 and was later\nnaturalized. Her parents married in about 1898. In 1910 there were three daughters\nliving of \ufb01ve children who had been born. The other two daughters were Esther\n(1902\u20131974) and Elizabeth (1905\u20131992). Their father was a barber in Moorhead.\n\nRuth Rasmusen attended the public schools of Moorhead and graduated from\nMoorhead High School in 1918. After three years at Concordia College in Moorhead,\nshe graduated summa cum laude with a mathematics major and a Latin minor. She\nwas a member of the Alpha Society, the scholastic honor society there.\n\nFor the next four years, 1921\u201325, Rasmusen taught in high schools in Minnesota\nand North Dakota. In the summer of 1925 she enrolled at the University of Chicago\nand studied there for \ufb01ve consecutive quarters before receiving her master\u2019s degree\nin September 1926.\n\nRasmusen indicated in her dissertation vita that she was a teacher at the senior\nhigh school in Muskegon, Michigan, for three semesters in 1927\u201328, an instructor at\nNorth Dakota State College (now University) in Fargo 1928\u201329, and an instructor\nat South Dakota State College (now University) in Brookings 1929\u201333. She con-\ntinued her graduate work at the University of Chicago, spending twelve quarters\nin residence between summer 1930 and summer 1936, after which she received her\ndoctorate with a dissertation in di\ufb00erential geometry directed by E. P. Lane. It\nappears that Rasmusen was living in her home town of Moorhead for a while af-\nter completing her graduate work. She was appointed instructor at the Platteville\nState Teachers College in Wisconsin (now University of Wisconsin\u2013Platteville) and\nbegan teaching there on January 3, 1938.\n\nRasmusen began her employment with the Chicago Board of Education at Woodrow\n\nWilson Junior College (now one of the City Colleges) in October 1938. She was\ntransferred from Wilson to Chicago Teachers College (now Chicago State Univer-\nsity) in September 1953. When rank was \ufb01rst established there in 1959, she was\nmade a full professor, one of 18 of the faculty of 137. Rasmusen became the secre-\ntary of the committee on promotion and wrote about the \ufb01rst few years of the new\npolicy in the Chicago Schools Journal in 1962. She also contributed book reviews\nto that journal.\n\nRasmusen\u2019s compulsory retirement occurred in June 1964. She then taught at\nKearney State College (now University of Nebraska at Kearney) for the academic\nyear 1964\u201365. The Chicago Teachers College became a state institution, Illinois\nTeachers College Chicago\u2013South, with a more lenient retirement policy, in Sep-\ntember 1965, and Rasmusen returned to work there until her second retirement in\n1967.\n\nRasmusen continued some research in di\ufb00erential geometry throughout the late\n1930s and early 1940s. Her published work includes a joint article in 1941 with\nBeatrice Hagen of Penn State, who had also been a student of Lane at Chicago.\nRasmusen served as an associate editor of Mathematics Magazine 1964\u201368. With\ntwo of her colleagues she wrote a text for use at Chicago Teachers College; in 1960\nit was published by Allyn and Bacon, with a second edition appearing in 1965.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nRASMUSEN - 2\n\nA pro\ufb01le written at Concordia indicates that she was chairman of the mathemat-\nics department at Wilson Junior College and that she inaugurated the mathematics\ncontest there. It notes that she also inaugurated the graduate department in mathe-\nmatics at Chicago State and sponsored Pi Mu Epsilon. She served as a judge at city\nmathematics and science fairs, read papers in the Chicago home study department,\nand taught by invitation at the Chicago Teachers Review School.\n\nA former colleague described Rasmusen as an excellent teacher. He said she was\ntall, slender, lovely, quiet, retiring, with a sense of humor. He indicated that she liked\nto travel and was a \u201crabid\u201d White Sox fan who knew the players\u2019 batting averages.\nA former student, who had a course in di\ufb00erential equations from Rasmusen in one\nof her last years of teaching, referred to her as adorable, kindly, concerned, caring,\nand stately. She said Rasmusen was ramrod straight and always well-prepared for\nclass.\n\nIn 1970 the Dr. Ruth B. Rasmusen Award was established at Chicago State; it is\ngiven annually to a mathematics major who shows outstanding promise as a scholar\nin the \ufb01eld of mathematics research. In 1972 she received an Alumni Achievement\nAward from the Concordia College Alumni Association.\n\nFor many years Rasmusen lived in Chicago with her sister Esther Rasmusen,\nwho was a biology teacher at a Chicago high school. Esther Rasmusen died in April\n1974; six months later Ruth Rasmusen died at age seventy-\ufb01ve in Minneapolis.

April 6, 1903\u2013January 13, 1991.\nHunter College (BA 1925), Columbia University (MA 1929), New York Uni-\nversity (PhD 1939).\n\nHarriet Madeline Gri\ufb03n was born in Brooklyn, New York, the \ufb01rst of two daugh-\nters of Mary Madeline (Gully) (1867\u20131937) and James Harry Gri\ufb03n (1872\u20131936),\nnatives of Brooklyn. Her mother had an elementary school education and became a\nhomemaker after her marriage in 1902. Her father received a high school education;\nhe was a salesman for a furniture store in 1910 and a buyer for a furniture house\nin 1920. Her sister, Jessie (1904\u20131971), became a high school mathematics teacher\nafter graduating from Hunter the same year as Harriet. Harriet Gri\ufb03n recalled\nin 1985 that her father liked mathematics and encouraged her involvement in the\nsubject.\n\nHarriet Gri\ufb03n attended Hunter College and while there gave two talks, on the\nmathematics of time and of astronomy, to the mathematics club and was a member\nof the Newman Club. She won the Thomas Hunter Prize in Mathematics when she\ngraduated in 1925. She was one of the charter members of Pi Mu Epsilon when it\nwas established at Hunter in 1925 and served as the chapter\u2019s \ufb01rst vice-director; in\nthe late 1950s she was one of the councilors-general at the national level.\n\nGri\ufb03n remained at Hunter as a tutor 1926\u201329 and as an instructor 1929\u201330.\nShe earned her master\u2019s degree from Columbia in 1929, having written her master\u2019s\nessay, \u201cModern Geometry in Three Dimensions.\u201d In 1930 the Brooklyn branch of the\nfemale-only Hunter College merged with the Brooklyn branch of the male-only City\nCollege to become the coeducational Brooklyn College. At that time Gri\ufb03n moved\nto a position at the newly opened college, and she remained on the faculty there for\nthirty-six years. While there she earned her PhD in 1939 at New York University\nwith a dissertation in abstract algebra. At that time she became a member of the\nKey Pin Society, an honorary society at NYU.\n\nGri\ufb03n began her career at Brooklyn College in 1930 as instructor in the women\u2019s\ndivision. Starting in 1932, the faculty was no longer divided between the men\u2019s and\nwomen\u2019s divisions, and she remained an instructor until 1940. She was assistant\nprofessor 1940\u201350, associate professor 1950\u201356, professor 1956\u201366, and professor\nemeritus after her retirement in 1966. Her teaching included advanced calculus,\ndi\ufb00erential equations, and abstract algebra and theory of matrices, but her major\ninterests lay in the theory of numbers. She is listed on the faculty of the graduate\ndivision starting 1946\u201347. From 1956 to 1964 she taught courses in arithmetic and\nalgebraic theory of numbers and in theory of matrices, and she was advisor for a\nnumber of master\u2019s theses in number theory in the graduate division at Brooklyn\nCollege. She used her own course notes for number theory and for abstract algebra.\nIn addition, Gri\ufb03n published a textbook in number theory that appeared in both\nhardback and paperback editions. After Gri\ufb03n\u2019s retirement from Brooklyn College\nshe taught two years, 1966\u201368, at Molloy College in Rockville Centre, New York.\n\nDuring World War II, Gri\ufb03n taught mathematics and did vocational counseling\nat the United Service Organization in New York.

Her older brother, John Wesley, was born in 1898. When the\n1900 census was enumerated, her parents, who had been married \ufb01ve years, and\nher brother were living with her maternal grandparents in Hackensack, New Jersey.\nLouisa Stokes died in childbirth six years later when the youngest child, David, was\nborn. John Edgar Stokes was a successful manufacturing representative with New\nEngland Yarn Company until after World War I. He was later involved in retail\nselling and owned an appliance store.\n\nEllen Stokes received most of her elementary and all of her secondary education\nat boarding schools in Beaver Dam, Wisconsin, where she \ufb01rst attended Hillcrest\nSchool and then Wayland Academy. Her father remarried in 1917, and he and his\nsecond wife, Wilhelmina (Birkho\ufb00) Stokes (1880\u20131975), had one daughter, Joan,\neighteen years younger than Ellen.\n\nThe Stokes family was living in Providence, Rhode Island, when Ellen Stokes\nentered Women\u2019s College in Brown University in 1919. While there she studied\nwith R. G. D. Richardson and R. C. Archibald, among others. She earned her\nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1923 and her master\u2019s degree the following year.\n\nIn 1924 Stokes accepted a position as instructor in mathematics at Coker College\nfor Women (now Coker College) in Hartsville, South Carolina. While she was at\nCoker, Stokes was considering further studies in mathematics. In a note to Richard-\nson in January 1925 she indicated that she had talked with Archibald about work\nfor the next year and he advised staying at Coker for another year for the sake of\nher reputation.\n\nAfter two years at Coker College, Stokes moved to the New York State College for\nTeachers in Albany (now the University at Albany, State University of New York),\nin part to be near family members who were living in the area. She spent the rest\nof her career there. In the summer of 1928, Stokes took three mathematics courses\nat Cornell University. Then, beginning in the summer of 1933, she studied for a\ntotal of nine quarters at the University of Chicago before receiving her doctorate\nthere in December 1939 with a dissertation in the calculus of variations.\n\nDuring the period of her studies at Chicago, Stokes remained an instructor in\nmathematics at the New York College for Teachers in Albany. In 1943 she became\ndean of women and stayed in that position until her retirement in 1965. A mathe-\nmatics colleague at Albany was Caroline A. Lester, who joined the faculty in 1929\nand lived in the same apartment building as Stokes in some of their earlier years in\nAlbany. In about the early 1950s, Stokes and two other women on the faculty, one\nin psychology and one in biology, bought a house in Albany, painted it pink, and\nshared the house for many years.\n\nEllen Stokes was described by her half-sister as about \ufb01ve feet six inches tall,\nof medium build, not beautiful, but very attractive. She was quiet and \u201cnever had\nan unpleasant word to say.\u201d She had a whimsical sense of humor and was fun to\nbe with.

Her parents were both born in Ohio,\nin 1882 and 1876, respectively, and married in about 1907. In 1910 the Le\ufb04ers were\nliving with Marjorie\u2019s maternal grandparents, and William Le\ufb04er\u2019s occupation was\ndescribed as commercial traveler. In 1920 there were four children: Marjorie; two\nbrothers, Homer (1913\u20131977) and Norman (1916\u20131997); and a sister, Ruth (1918\u2013\n2006). The family farmed their own land in Butler County, Ohio.\n\nMarjorie Le\ufb04er received her primary education in the local township school and\nher secondary education in the high school of Hamilton, Ohio. In 1930 she graduated\nfrom Miami University in neighboring Oxford, Ohio, magna cum laude, with honors\nin mathematics and with general honors. As an undergraduate Le\ufb04er was involved\nin many activities. These included several sports (hockey, soccer, baseball, and\ntrack); classical club; debate; Alethenai, a national literary society; student-faculty\ncouncil; disciplinary board; and the year book. She was elected to the honor societies\nPhi Beta Kappa, Kappa Delta Pi (education), Tau Kappa Alpha (journalism), and\nto Mortar Board.\n\nAll of Le\ufb04er\u2019s graduate work was done at Ohio State University in Columbus.\nIn 1931 she was awarded a university scholarship in mathematics, which she held\nfor two years. She earned a master\u2019s degree in 1932; the following year she was\nan assistant in the university high school while continuing her work for the PhD.\nShe also was treasurer of the local chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon that year. Both her\nmaster\u2019s thesis and her doctoral dissertation were in analysis and were directed by\nTibor Rad\u00b4o.\n\nAfter completing her work at Ohio State in 1934, Le\ufb04er took a position as tutor\nand instructor at Mills College in California for 1934\u201335. On December 20, 1934,\nMarjorie Le\ufb04er married Howard Holston Alden (1908\u20131998), also of Ohio. He had\nreceived a BS from Carnegie Institute of Technology in 1930 and an MA in 1931 and\na PhD in 1933 in mathematics from Ohio State. In July 1933, he was looking for\njobs; one inquiry was to the president of the University of Saskatchewan in which\nhe indicated that he was seeking a permanent position in Canada and that he had\nhad four years of teaching experience at the Carnegie Institute of Technology and\nat Ohio State.\n\nMarjorie Le\ufb04er Alden\u2019s subsequent academic positions were at the same in-\nstitutions as her husband\u2019s, but at lower ranks. Howard H. Alden was head of\nthe mathematics department at New Mexico Military Institute, a junior college in\nRoswell, from 1934 to 1943; was associate professor at the University of Wyoming\n1945\u201346; and returned to Ohio State University as assistant professor in 1946. He\nwas also involved with jet propulsion research during World War II and was a chief\nengineer working under Robert H. Goddard 1942\u201345. During this period, Marjorie\nL. Alden was an instructor at New Mexico Military Institute 1936\u201343, instructor\nat the University of Wyoming 1945\u201346, and instructor at Ohio State starting in\n1946. Howard Holston Alden was promoted to associate professor at Ohio State in\n1948, while Marjorie Le\ufb04er Alden remained as instructor.

March 1, 1898\u2013March 19, 1978.\nKnox College (BA 1920), University of Iowa (MS 1921), University of Chicago\n(PhD 1928).\n\nMarie Mathilda Johnson was born in Galesburg, Illinois, the younger of two children\nof Ellen (Olson), born in 1867, and Oscar William Johnson, born in 1866, both natives of\nIllinois. Her parents married in 1890, and her brother, Eugene R., was born in September\n1892. Her father was proprietor of a grocery store. Marie Johnson attended grammar\nschool and high school in Galesburg, where the family lived.\n\nJohnson attended Knox College, also in Galesburg, where Helen Calkins, BA Knox\nCollege 1916, was instructor of mathematics 1918\u201320, and Sally Elizabeth Carlson, MA\nUniversity of Minnesota 1918, was instructor of mathematics and physics 1919\u201320. Johnson\nreceived her BA in 1920 and eight years later became that school\u2019s \ufb01rst graduate to receive\na PhD in mathematics (Calkins did not receive her Cornell PhD until 1932). Johnson\nstudied with H. L. Rietz and E. W. Chittenden at the University of Iowa 1920\u201321 and\nreceived her master\u2019s degree in 1921 with a major in mathematics and a minor in education.\nIn 1921 Johnson became an instructor at Lake Forest College in Lake Forest, Illinois.\nDuring the summers of 1922 through 1926 she attended the University of Chicago. Her\nlast year at Lake Forest, 1925\u201326, she was assistant professor and acting head of the\ndepartment. After leaving Lake Forest she held a fellowship at the University of Chicago\nfor the year 1926\u201327 before receiving her doctorate in 1928 having written a dissertation\nin the calculus of variations.\n\nIn 1927 Johnson accepted an instructorship at Pennsylvania State College but was\nreleased from that contract in order to go to Oberlin College in Ohio as an acting assistant\nprofessor replacing Mary E. Sinclair who was on leave at the University of Miami in Coral\nGables. Johnson\u2019s position became permanent, and she was assistant professor 1928 until\n1943, when she was promoted to associate professor. She had a leave of absence during\nthe academic year 1937\u201338 and spent the year in residence at the Institute for Advanced\nStudy in Princeton.\n\nIn the fall of 1935, shortly after the MAA formed its Committee on Tests with one\nwoman member, Clara E. Smith, professor emeritus at Wellesley, Johnson was added to\nthe committee in order \u201cto assist in the secretarial work of the committee and in the\nconstruction of tests\u201d (\u201cReport of the Committee on Tests\u201d 1940, 290). The report of\nthe committee speci\ufb01cally acknowledged Johnson\u2019s contributions in preparing the 1936\ntests as well as in compiling questions for the tests for junior college mathematics and for\ntrigonometry.\n\nOn October 27, 1943, Marie Johnson married Chester Henry Yeaton (1886\u20131970) who\nhad come to Oberlin as an assistant professor of mathematics in 1921. Chester H. Yeaton\nwas born in Maine and received his bachelor\u2019s degree at Bowdoin College in 1908. He\nreceived his master\u2019s degree at Harvard in 1909 and his PhD at Chicago in 1915 under\nthe direction of E. J. Wilczynski. In 1923 Chester H. Yeaton had married Ethel May\nKitch, who held a PhD from Chicago and was on the faculty of Oberlin\u2019s psychology and\nphilosophy departments before she died in May 1941.\n\nAt the time of his marriage to Marie M. Johnson, Chester H. Yeaton was professor of\nmathematics. Marie Johnson Yeaton formally resigned from the Oberlin faculty e\ufb00ective\nMarch 1, 1944. In November 1944 she was appointed acting associate professor for the\nwinter term. She held the position again in the second semester of 1951\u201352, after which\nChester H. Yeaton retired. He died in Oberlin in 1970 at age eighty-three.\n\nAfter her marriage Marie M. Yeaton continued her membership in the Oberlin Math-\nematics Club. She had previously served as faculty advisor to the club and in 1940 con-\ntributed bibliographies on \u201cNomographs\u201d (with Dale Leipper) and \u201cConstructions with\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nYEATON - 2\n\ncompasses alone\u201d to a section on club topics in the Monthly (47:106\u20137). Yeaton was also a\nmember of the Oberlin Social Science Club, and for two years she served as the president\nof the Beta Gamma chapter of Delta Kappa Gamma, an education honorary society. In\nthe mid-1940s she was treasurer of the Oberlin branch of the AAUW. In 1939 she reported\nthat she was a Lutheran and a Republican and listed her favorite hobby as photography\nand her favorite recreation as swimming. In the 1960s she was a member of the Button\nClub of Wellington.\n\nMarie Yeaton died in Allen Memorial Hospital in Oberlin, Ohio, at age eighty, having\nbeen a resident at the Welcome Nursing Home for the previous \ufb01ve years. Her only survivor\nwas Evelyn Yeaton, a sister-in-law living in Elyria, Ohio, about ten miles from Oberlin.\nYeaton was buried in Westwood Cemetery in Oberlin.\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Sigma Xi, AAUW.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1921 [Johnson, M.

September 28, 1901\u2013October 24, 1968.\nWellesley College (BA 1921), Columbia University (Teachers College) (MA\n1924), Radcliffe College (PhD 1932).\n\nHelen Gertrude Russell was born in Gorham, Maine, the third of six children of\nWinifred Parker (Stone) (1869\u20131970) of Bucksport, Maine, and Walter Earle Russell\n(1869\u20131948) of Fayette, Maine. Her mother graduated from Maine Wesleyan Female\nCollege in Kent\u2019s Hill and taught at Bridgton Academy in North Bridgton, Maine,\nand at Miss Porter\u2019s School in Farmington, Connecticut, before her marriage in\n1896. Her father, a graduate of Wesleyan University, was a faculty member and,\nfor thirty-\ufb01ve years, principal of the Gorham Normal School, a predecessor of the\nUniversity of Southern Maine. Her parents had three sons: Earl Stone (1897\u20131973),\nWillis Cleaves (1898\u20131986), and Robert Edward (b. 1906); their two other daughters\nwere Muriel Lincoln, who was born in December 1904 and died in June 1905, and\nCelia Asenath (1909\u20131995). Her two older brothers both received PhDs: Earle in\neducation from Yale in 1934 and Willis in history from American University in 1932.\nIt was reported in a genealogy published in 1926 that Robert was in the Wesleyan\nclass of 1927 and that Celia was in the Wellesley class of 1929.\n\nHelen Russell attended Gorham schools before entering Wellesley College. After\nher college graduation in 1921, she taught mathematics and Latin in the high school\nin Mt. Holly, New Jersey, 1921\u201323, and mathematics in the Horace Mann School\nfor Girls in New York City 1923\u201327. She earned a master\u2019s degree from Teachers\nCollege, Columbia, in 1924. For two issues of the 1924 Mathematics Teacher, the\nsections on mathematics clubs were prepared by Russell and four other members\nof David Eugene Smith\u2019s 1923\u201324 Teachers College class in teaching mathematics\nin secondary schools.\n\nRussell returned to Massachusetts in 1927 to continue her graduate work at\nRadcli\ufb00e College. She was also an instructor at Wellesley 1928\u201329. In a February\n1930 letter to David Eugene Smith regarding a reference for a Radcli\ufb00e scholarship,\nRussell wrote from Cambridge, \u201cThree years ago I left Horace Mann School to come\nhere to do graduate work in mathematics. Last year I taught two freshman classes\nat Wellesley and consequently did very little work at Radcli\ufb00e. This year I am\nagain doing full time work\u201d (Professional Correspondence, David Eugene Smith\nProfessional Collection, Archival Collections, Rare Book and Manuscript Library,\nColumbia University Libraries). She completed her work at Radcli\ufb00e in 1932. Her\ndissertation in analysis was directed by J. L. Walsh, and a paper she coauthored\nwith him bearing the title of her dissertation appeared the following year in the\nTransactions of the AMS. Her collaboration with Walsh, who had received his\ndoctorate from Harvard a dozen years earlier and spent most of his career as a\nfaculty member there, continued for more than thirty years.\n\nRussell again joined the mathematics department at Wellesley in 1932, the year\nHelen Abbot Merrill retired after nearly forty years on the faculty, the last sixteen\nas department chairman. Russell remained at Wellesley for the rest of her career\nexcept for leaves. She was instructor 1932\u201336, assistant professor 1936\u201345, associate\nprofessor 1945\u201351, professor 1951\u201366, and emeritus professor after her retirement\nin 1966. She was also named chairman in 1952 and the Helen Day Gould professor\nof mathematics in 1955; she held that professorship until her retirement.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nRUSSELL - 2\n\nWhile at Wellesley, Russell continued her research in complex analysis and con-\ntributed research articles and reviews to journals. She took several leaves, possibly\nall sabbaticals; the \ufb01rst, in 1942\u201343, was at the University of California. Her next\nthree leaves were all at Harvard. The \ufb01rst of these was during the \ufb01rst semester\nof 1949\u201350 when she worked at Widener Library and audited a course with Oscar\nZariski. Her next two leaves were in 1956\u201357 and in 1963\u201364. During her last leave\nshe was a research fellow in mathematics. After each of these leaves Russell pub-\nlished a paper jointly with J. L. Walsh. The last of these papers appeared in 1966,\nthe year they both retired. This last joint paper was the second part of a paper\n\ufb01rst published by Walsh the previous year.\n\nRussell was also an active participant in college committee work and other ex-\ntracurricular activities. At various times she served on the board of admission and\non the administrative board. She was also a member of committees on scholarships;\nstudent records; curriculum and instruction; the library; war activities; nominations;\nreappointments, promotions and dismissals; and appointments. She participated in\nthe Shop Club, the Chapel Board, and the General Court, and was a class dean.\n\nHer professional activities included serving on the council of the Association of\nTeachers of Mathematics in New England and on a committee on summer institutes\nfor mathematics teachers. She was a member of the entertainment committee for\nvarious meetings, including the International Mathematical Congress in Cambridge,\nMassachusetts, in 1950. She was also on a committee on a cooperative Harvard plan\nfor the preparation of teachers.\n\nRussell was a Radcli\ufb00e alumna member of Phi Beta Kappa and held o\ufb03ces in the\nWellesley chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, and AAUP. She was a Republican\nand a Methodist. She was an enthusiastic traveler, whose trips included travel in\nEurope in 1925 and 1927, in the western United States in the summers of 1937 and\n1939, and in the Orient in 1963\u201364 with her mother who was then ninety-\ufb01ve.\n\nHelen G. Russell died in 1968 at age sixty-seven in Portland, Maine, after a brief\nillness.

      "text": "GENTRY, Ruth. February 22, 1862\u2013October 18, 1917.\nUniversity of Michigan (PhB 1890), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1894).\n\nRuth Ellen Gentry was born in Stilesville, Indiana, the daughter of Lucre-\ntia (1830\u20131909), born in Indiana, and Jeremiah Gentry (1827\u20131906), from Ken-\ntucky. Her father was a farmer and stock trader, and later dry goods merchant, in\nStilesville, southwest of Indianapolis. She had at least two older siblings: a brother,\nOliver (1853\u20131878), and a sister, Sarah F. (b. ca 1855).\n\nRuth Gentry attended the public schools of Stilesville. According to the Gentry\nfamily genealogy, she began teaching school at age sixteen and later used her savings\nto pay her way through college. She graduated from the Indiana State Normal\nSchool in Terre Haute in 1880 and \u201cspent the next ten years in preparatory and\ncollege teaching, and in study in the University of Michigan\u201d (PhD dissertation\n\u201cLife\u201d). She was formally admitted to the University of Michigan in October 1885.\nIn a history of women at Michigan, a fellow student is quoted as describing the\natmosphere for women taking mathematics classes with engineering students: \u201cRuth\nGentry and I were the only girls in a large class of engineers. We had front seats and\nleft the room \ufb01rst. I never did see the faces of those young men in class\u201d (Bordin,\n19). Before completing her undergraduate work she taught for two years. In 1886\u2013\n88, she was Preceptress and Teacher of Mathematics and Mathematical Sciences\nin Deland, Florida. The school was called DeLand Academy and College her \ufb01rst\nyear, and college preparatory classes were the highest level taught. Her second year\nthere the school was called Deland University, and three students were enrolled in\nthe college department. It became John B. Stetson University a year later. Gentry\ngraduated from the University of Michigan with the PhB degree in 1890.\n\nThat fall Ruth Gentry began her graduate studies at Bryn Mawr College and held\nthe fellowship in mathematics 1890\u201391. She was awarded the European Fellowship\nof the Association of Collegiate Alumnae for the year 1891\u201392. She \ufb01rst went to\nBerlin, where she knew people. She described her situation in a June 1892 article\nas follows:\n\nIn America, I had heard that a woman was occasionally permit-\nted, as an exceptional favor, to become a a sort of supposed-to-be-\ninvisible guest in lectures in some universities of Germany; that in\nBerlin, however, all e\ufb00ort to secure such exceptional privilege would\nbe utterly useless. . . . I made inquiries of various prominent Profes-\nsors of Mathematics elsewhere than in Berlin; result, a collection of\nletters now treasured as souvenirs, no show of hope for me except\nin Leipzig, where the work in Mathematics was not exactly suited\nto my purpose, and a state of mind well adapted to lead to suicide.\nHaving nursed my despair till the University [of Berlin] had of-\n\ufb01cially opened, I concluded to seek a long-desired interview with\nProf. Fuchs and \u201cview the prospect o\u2019er\u201d for myself. Prof. Fuchs\ndid not politely \u201cthank me for the honor, etc., while regretting to\nbe unable to admit a woman to his lectures;\u201d he did not assure\nme Mathematics was a di\ufb03cult subject which women, for the most\npart, could not comprehend (as one Professor had written); he did\nnot, as the Rector of one University did, advise me to apply to the\nMinisterium, and accompany his advice with the assurance that\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGENTRY - 2\n\nmy request would not be granted; he did not make me feel that a\nwoman possessed of an interest in Mathematics was a sort of natural\ncuriosity, whose existence demanded explanation. He asked me in\nhis quiet, restful way, what I had done in Mathematics and under\nwhose instruction, talked a minute or two about Briot and Bou-\nquet\u2019s Fonctions Elliptiques, and told me to ask the Rector of the\nUniversity whether a way could not be found to favor my petition.\n(1892, 45\u201346)\n\nWith the backing of Professor Lazarus Immanuel Fuchs, Rector F\u00a8orster approved\nher request as long as the lecturers did not object. A month later that approval was\nrevoked when it was discovered that in 1884, despite approval of a similar request by\nthe University Senate, \u201cthe Ministerium had strictly, speci\ufb01cally forbidden\u201d such\narrangements (1892, 46). Nonetheless, the Rector allowed her to continue attending\nthe lectures of Fuchs and Dr. Ludwig Schlesinger until the end of the semester. She\nremained in Europe through the \ufb01rst semester of 1892\u201393 and attended lectures by\nProfessors \u00b4Emile Picard, Gaston Darboux, and Louis Ra\ufb00y at the Sorbonne, before\nreturning to the United States in February 1893.\n\nJames C. Albisetti claims that Gentry may have had more impact on the admis-\nsion of women to German universities than any other American woman. Although\nshe studied one semester at Berlin, Albisetti claims that she applied \ufb01rst to the\nUniversity of Heidelberg and was turned down on October 20, 1891. Just nine\ndays later, however, \u201cin\ufb02uenced by her application and that of Marie Gernet from\nKarlsruhe, \ufb01ve members of the mathematics-sciences faculty proposed that women\nshould be allowed to study at Heidelberg with any professors who would have them.\nThe university senate rejected this idea but was overridden by Baden\u2019s Ministry of\nEducation, which . . . gave them permission to audit courses in the mathematics-\nsciences faculty\u201d (Albisetti, 225).\n\nGentry again held the fellowship in mathematics at Bryn Mawr in 1892\u201393 and\nwas a fellow by courtesy there in 1893\u201394. In February 1894 she was elected to\nmembership in the New York Mathematical Society, which became the American\nMathematical Society a few months later. Gentry passed her examinations for the\nPhD degree in June 1894. In 1895 she was made a member of the academic council at\nBryn Mawr College. Her dissertation, which appeared in printed form in 1896, was\nwritten under the direction of Charlotte A. Scott, whom she acknowledged by noting\nthat, \u201cI \ufb01nd it hard adequately to express my indebtedness and my gratitude for\nthe inspiration derived from her unfailing interest in my work.\u201d Gentry was Scott\u2019s\n\ufb01rst PhD student; however, because of the delay in the printing of her dissertation,\nshe is often listed as sharing that honor with Isabel Maddison who received her\ndegree in 1896.\n\nGentry began teaching at Vassar College in 1894. She was instructor 1894\u20131900\nand associate professor 1900\u201302. In her earliest years there, she taught courses\nin solid and spherical geometry, plane trigonometry, determinants and theory of\nequations, curve tracing, analytic geometry of three dimensions, modern methods\nin analytic geometry, and analytic mechanics, among possibly others. In 1901\u201302\nshe played cornet in the Vassar symphony orchestra.\n\nShe left Vassar in 1902 and took a position as associate principal and head teacher\nof mathematics at Miss Gleim\u2019s School for Girls, a private school in Pittsburgh,\nwhere she remained until 1905. In December 1905, Gentry reported to the Michigan\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGENTRY - 3\n\nalumni o\ufb03ce that her address was Stilesville, and in December 1909 and October\n1910, she reported an Indianapolis address. In 1910 she also gave her occupation\nas unsalaried nursing. A later note indicated that she was doing charity work in\nStilesville. From 1911 to 1914, she travelled in the United States and Europe and\narrived back in the United States from Europe in February 1914. In August 1916,\nshe reported that she was living in Indianapolis.\n\nA vita published in 1929 by the AAUW reports that \u201cDr. Gentry was increasingly\nill from the time she left Vassar until her death\u201d (Maltby, 13). Obituaries indicate\nthat she came from the East three weeks before her death to enter the Methodist\nHospital in Indianapolis, where she died at age \ufb01fty-\ufb01ve in October 1917.

      "text": "MEARS, Florence M. May 18, 1896\u2013December 3, 1995.\nGoucher College (BA 1917), Cornell University (MA 1924, PhD 1927).\n\nFlorence Marie Mears was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of Flo-\nrence Kate (Waidlich) (1867\u20131966) and Frank G. Mears (b. 1863), both natives of\nPennsylvania. Her mother attended college for one year, while her father had a high\nschool education; they married in 1895. Her father was manager of a farm imple-\nments store. Her twin brother, John W. Mears (1896\u20131988), was her only sibling.\nHis obituary notes that he was a retired railroad engineer, a WWI Navy veteran,\nand retired from Aberdeen Proving Ground in Maryland.\n\nThe Mears family lived in Baltimore while Florence Mears was growing up, and\nit is likely that she attended elementary and high school in that city. She graduated\nas a mathematics major from Goucher College in 1917. A letter of recommendation\nwritten several years later indicates that she had assisted in the physical and chem-\nical laboratories at Eastern High School in Baltimore for \ufb01ve years, presumably\njust after her graduation from Goucher.\n\nMears began her formal graduate studies during the summer of 1922, when she\nstudied invariants and covariants at the Johns Hopkins University. The following\nsummer she was at Cornell University, where she enrolled in a course in education\nand courses in advanced calculus and advanced analytic geometry. She remained\nat Cornell during the academic year 1923\u201324, taking four mathematics courses a\nsemester and earning her masters degree in June 1924.\n\nMears returned to Cornell in 1925 and received her doctorate in June 1927. She\nheld one of three graduate scholarships in mathematics 1925\u201326 and a fellowship her\nlast year. In addition to her work in analysis and geometry, she also took courses,\nand minored, in physics. After receiving her PhD, Mears served for one year as\nhead of the department at Alabama College, then a women\u2019s college and now the\ncoeducational University of Montevallo. She served as acting assistant professor at\nPennsylvania State College the following year, 1928\u201329.\n\nIn 1929 Mears began her career at George Washington University in Washington,\nD.C., as an assistant professor. In 1930 she was living with her widowed mother\nin nearby Bethesda, Maryland, where she continued to reside. She was promoted\nto associate professor in 1936 and to professor in 1944. She continued her work in\nthe general area of her dissertation, the summability of divergent series. The most\nfrequently cited of her results appeared in 1937 in the Annals of Mathematics, soon\nafter her promotion to associate professor; this article continued to be cited for\nmore than \ufb01fty years. Her last two research papers appeared after her promotion\nto professor. Mears directed nine master\u2019s theses between 1949 and 1964 and two\ndoctoral dissertations at George Washington. Her \ufb01rst doctoral student, Joseph\nBlum, received his degree in 1958, when Mears was sixty-two, and her second,\nJanos Edvard Hanson, two years later. George Washington had awarded only four\ndoctorates in mathematics prior to these: two in the 1930s and two in the early\n1950s.\n\nIn 1939 Mears was elected president of the George Washington University Faculty\nClub; she was the \ufb01rst woman elected to that o\ufb03ce. The following year she served as\nan o\ufb03cer of the local chapter of Phi Beta Kappa. She was active in the Maryland-\nDistrict of Columbia-Virginia Section of the MAA; she served as secretary of the\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMEARS - 2\n\nsection 1949\u201350 and was on the executive committee 1951\u201352. Mears was also a\nmember of the Washington Academy of Sciences.\n\nMears retired from George Washington University as professor emeritus in June\n1966. At that time the citation from the university president included the following:\n\nThe chairman of her department and the Dean of Columbian Col-\nlege of Arts and Sciences have commended her for her excellence\nas a teacher, her contributions to research, her vital contributions\nto the Department of Mathematics, and for the esteem in which\nher students hold her. In 1955 she received an Alumni Citation for\ntwenty-\ufb01ve years of distinguished service. In 1958 the University\nof California selected her as one of ten women mathematicians as\nconsultants for a Mathematics Project for the study of creativity.\nIn 1962 she was a member of the Examining Committee for doc-\ntoral dissertations in mathematics for the University of Allahabad,\nIndia. (George Washington University Archives)\n\nAfter her retirement from George Washington, Mears was immediately hired by\nHoward University, also in Washington, D.C., where she taught for another ten\nyears. After her second retirement, at age eighty, Mears remained in Bethesda,\nMaryland, where \u201cher interests included gardening, knitting, cross-stitching and\nlace-making\u201d according to an obituary in the Washington Post. \u201cShe became a\nmaster weaver and was a member of the Potomac Craftsmen in Washington and\nthe Twenty Weavers.\u201d In the late 1940s she had included \u201cdogs\u201d as one of her\nhobbies. In 1949 an article in the George Washington University alumni magazine\nnoted her interest in growing roses and in Robin, her Dandie Dinmont terrier.\n\nFlorence Mears died at Suburban Hospital in Bethesda of heart disease at age\n\nninety-nine in 1995.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Phi Beta Kappa, Phi Kappa Phi, Sigma Xi.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1924 A special function of one variable.

      "text": "MANGOLD, Sister Marie Cecilia. December 5, 1872\u2013February 9, 1934.\nTrinity College (Washington, D.C.) (BS 1910, MS 1914), Catholic University\nof America (PhD 1929).\n\nJosephine Margaret Mangold was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, the daughter of\nMary Anna (Hemann), born in Cincinnati in 1843, and Matthew Mangold, born\nin Bavaria, Germany, in about 1833. Eight of their children survived of ten born.\nThey were Mary P. (b. ca. 1866), Anna (b. ca. 1868), Laura (b. ca. 1870), Philomena\n(b. ca. 1871), Josephine (b. 1872), Edward (b. ca. 1877), Matthew (b. 1881), and\nAnthony (b. 1882). Their father was a dealer in imported wines, brandies, and\nliquor; their mother was a housewife who was widowed by 1900.\n\nJosephine Mangold attended parochial school and later the Academy of the Sis-\nters of Notre Dame de Namur in Cincinnati. In March 1898 she entered the novitiate\nof the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur in that city and professed in August 1900.\nAt that time the Ohio Province of the Sisters of Notre Dame embraced all founda-\ntions east of the Rocky Mountains, so after Sister Marie Cecilia Mangold taught in\nthe high school at Notre Dame Academy in Cincinnati, she was sent to Washington,\nD.C., in January 1901, to Trinity College, which now calls itself Trinity (Washing-\nton) University. There she was to assist in the teaching of German and to study\nmathematics with Sister Blandina of the original Trinity faculty.\n\nTrinity College was established in 1897 and \ufb01rst o\ufb00ered instruction at the post-\nsecondary level in 1900. Sister Marie Cecilia began to teach mathematics there in\n1902. The bachelor\u2019s degree was \ufb01rst conferred at Trinity in 1904; that year Sister\nMarie Cecilia succeeded Sister Blandina and then directed the mathematics de-\npartment until her death in 1934. While teaching at Trinity College, she also took\ncourses there. Her entrance credits included a Trinity College exam, high school\ncerti\ufb01cate, and normal courses she had taken previously. She completed the work\nfor her BS degree in 1910 with major subjects mathematics and physics. She took\nno mathematics courses at Trinity, having been given credit for the elementary\ncourses from the Notre Dame normal courses and having done all of her advanced\nwork in both mathematics and physics privately, most likely under the guidance of\nfaculty from the Catholic University of America. She continued her private study\nand earned an MS from Trinity in 1914 with a mathematics major and chemistry\nminor. Her master\u2019s degree was granted just prior to the opening of Catholic Sis-\nters College, which formalized the practice of teaching women religious at Catholic\nUniversity.\n\nSince women religious were not listed in the register of students at Catholic Uni-\nversity until 1928\u201329, public documents do not indicate when Sister Marie Cecilia\nbegan taking courses there. She studied mathematics under Aubrey E. Landry, his-\ntory of science under Rev. Patrick W. Brown, and educational measurement under\nT. G. Foran at Catholic University. She wrote two papers in educational measure-\nment, which appeared in 1927 and 1929. After writing a dissertation in algebraic\ngeometry under the direction of Landry, Sister Marie Cecilia received her PhD in\n1929 with a minor in education. She was the second woman religious in this country\nto earn a PhD in mathematics; the \ufb01rst was Sister Mary Gervase (Kelley) in 1917.\nDuring her more than thirty years on the faculty at Trinity College, Sister Marie\nCecilia was either the only member, or one of two members, of the mathematics\ndepartment. In her earliest years in the department she taught trigonometry, solid\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMANGOLD - 2\n\ngeometry, analytic geometry, advanced algebra, di\ufb00erential and integral calculus,\ntheory of equations, theory of determinants, and history of mathematics. In 1907\u2013\n08 she introduced analytical mechanics, and in 1910\u201311 advanced calculus and a\nteachers\u2019 course with a calculus prerequisite. In 1914\u201315 three courses for graduates,\ndi\ufb00erential equations, vector analysis, and projective geometry, were added to the\ncurriculum; in 1919\u201320 practical mathematics for students in physics and practical\nmathematics for students in chemistry were introduced; and in 1923\u201324 a course in\nstatistical methods was added. The Pascal Circle, the Trinity College mathematics\nclub, was organized in 1916 with Sister Marie Cecilia the faculty advisor and hon-\norary president. In a memorial article after her death it was reported that \u201cshe was\na lover of the classics, and a \ufb01rm believer in the adage, \u2018The best mathematician\nis a student in every \ufb01eld\u2019 \u201d (\u201cIn Memoriam\u201d).\n\nSister Marie Cecilia was in ill health for a number of years before her death at the\ncollege in 1934 at age sixty-one. Among the pallbearers at her funeral were Aubrey\nE. Landry and Otto J. Ramler of the mathematics department at Catholic Univer-\nsity. She is buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Washington, D.C.

      "text": "BACON, Clara L. August 13, 1866\u2013April 14, 1948.\nHedding College (PhB 1886), Wellesley College (BA 1890), University of\nChicago (MA 1904), Johns Hopkins University (PhD 1911).\n\nClara Latimer Bacon was born in Hillsgrove, Illinois, the daughter of Louisa\n(Latimer) (1831\u20131914) of Abingdon, Illinois, and Larkin Crouch Bacon (1818\u20131877),\noriginally from Tennessee. Her father was a farmer and dealt in stock. Her parents\nmarried, each for a second time, in 1864. Clara was the eldest of four children of this\nmarriage; her siblings were a sister, Nannie (1867\u20131880); a brother, Willie Larkin\n(ca. 1871\u20131880); and a sister, Agnes Latimer (1874\u20131930).\n\nClara Bacon attended primary school at the Hillsgrove county school and sec-\nondary school at the North Abingdon High School. After receiving her PhB in 1886\nfrom Hedding College in Abingdon, Bacon taught for the year 1886\u201387 at a private\nschool in Dover, Kansas. She enrolled at Wellesley College in 1887 and received\nher second bachelor\u2019s degree in 1890. When she later received her PhD, the Welles-\nley instructor whom she singled out for thanks was Ellen Hayes, who had gone\nto Wellesley in 1879 shortly after she received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Oberlin\nCollege.\n\nAfter graduating from Wellesley, Bacon taught for seven years (1890\u201397) at four\ndi\ufb00erent schools. The \ufb01rst year she taught in a private school in Litch\ufb01eld, Kentucky,\nand the next two years she taught mathematics and German and served as librarian\nat Hedding College. During 1893\u201395 she was principal of North Abingdon High\nSchool, and \ufb01nally, during 1895\u201397 she was preceptress and teacher of mathematics\nat Grand Prairie Seminary, a secondary school in Onarga in eastern Illinois.\n\nIn 1897 Bacon was hired as an instructor at Woman\u2019s College of Baltimore\n(Goucher College after 1910), beginning a career there that was to last until 1934.\nIn 1897 the only other mathematician on the faculty was William H. Maltbie, who\nin 1891 had used the president of Hedding College as a reference for admission\nto the Johns Hopkins University and who had earned his doctorate from Johns\nHopkins in 1895. At the time that Bacon went to Maryland, her sister Agnes had\njust earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in physics at Wellesley, and they both moved to\nBaltimore with their mother.\n\nDuring the summers of 1901 to 1904, Bacon studied at the University of Chicago.\nShe completed her thesis in 1903, received her master\u2019s degree in September 1904,\nand was promoted to associate professor at Woman\u2019s College the following year.\nShe also studied at Chicago during the summers of 1907 and 1908.\n\nIn 1907 the trustees of Johns Hopkins voted to allow women to be admitted to\ngraduate courses without the special permission that had been needed by Chris-\ntine Ladd (Ladd-Franklin) in 1878 and Charlotte Barnum in 1890. The resolution\nadopted did permit individual instructors to object to women in their classes, how-\never. In September 1907, Bacon applied to Johns Hopkins to study mathematics;\nin October 1910, she applied for candidacy for the PhD degree in mathematics\nwith subordinate subjects education and philosophy. One of the courses she used\nto ful\ufb01ll the philosophy requirement was a 1908\u201309 course in symbolic logic with\nChristine Ladd-Franklin.\n\nDuring 1909\u201311 Bacon was a fellow by courtesy at Johns Hopkins, and during\nthe second of these two years she held a fellowship from the Baltimore Association\nfor the Promotion of the University Education of Women, an organization that\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBACON - 2\n\nLadd-Franklin had helped to organize in 1897. During this period Bacon\u2019s sister\nAgnes was a physics student at Johns Hopkins, and in 1914 she was a mathematics\nstudent at the University of Chicago. Agnes Bacon worked at the Johns Hopkins\nSchool of Hygiene and Public Health and published several articles in the \ufb01eld of\nbiometrics during the early 1920s.\n\nClara Bacon received her PhD from Johns Hopkins in 1911, the \ufb01rst year Johns\nHopkins granted PhD\u2019s to women without special approval of the trustees. She\nwas one of four women to receive a PhD from Johns Hopkins that year, the only\none of the four in mathematics. She was, however, the second woman to earn a\nPhD in mathematics from Johns Hopkins; Ladd-Franklin, the \ufb01rst in 1882, was not\nawarded the degree until 1926.\n\nBacon was one of the \ufb01rst two women to study mathematics at Johns Hopkins\nunder its new policy. The other was Florence P. Lewis, who was enrolled full time\nduring 1907\u201308, joined the mathematics faculty at the Woman\u2019s College of Balti-\nmore in 1908, completed her work for the PhD at Johns Hopkins in 1913, and also\nspent the rest of her career at Goucher College.\n\nIn 1913 Bacon published her dissertation in the American Journal of Mathemat-\nics and the following year was promoted to professor. She remained in that rank\nuntil she retired in 1934 as professor emeritus. Her only other teaching position was\nduring the summer of 1922 at Hunter College. During her years at Goucher, stu-\ndents, faculty colleagues, and administrators all valued her teaching, organization,\nand general humanity. After her death a colleague wrote: \u201cFew people have given\na more constant and loyal devotion to Goucher College. To the amazement of her\ncolleagues, Miss Bacon never lost her keen zest in the whole round of college ac-\ntivities, from Matriculation Vespers all the way to Commencement Exercises. The\nsecret of this un\ufb02agging delight lay, I believe, in her real interest in every one of\nher students, and in her warm friendly feelings toward her colleagues\u201d (Lewis 1948,\n20).\n\nWhile Bacon was on the Goucher mathematics faculty, ten women graduated who\nlater received PhD\u2019s in mathematics. Of these ten, seven received their doctorates\nfrom the Johns Hopkins University. At the time of Bacon\u2019s retirement, Marguerite\nLehr, who had graduated from Goucher in 1919, wrote that \u201cfor those students\nwho majored in mathematics [Bacon\u2019s] relation with the Johns Hopkins University\nwas of great importance. Advanced work sometimes took particular form because\nof a senior\u2019s plan to continue her work there\u201d (1934, 3). Bacon not only encouraged\nwomen to go to graduate school but assisted many \ufb01nancially so that they could do\nso. After her death, an administrator wrote that \u201cin committees Dr. Bacon fought\nfor the individual who was not brilliant but who was potentially a good and useful\ncitizen, and her judgment was usually sound. It was understood that a student\nwho was good, but not quite good enough to receive a scholarship, might receive\n\ufb01nancial help from her. We felt it wise to be on guard against letting her hear\nof too many such cases\u201d (Lewis 1948, 20). Bacon was also generous to Goucher;\ntwo years before her retirement she provided the institution with funds so that the\ndepartment could purchase a Monroe calculating machine.\n\nBacon was active in many organizations. She was a charter member of the MAA\nand stood for election to the board of trustees in 1922 and for vice president in 1924\nand 1929. Although she was never elected to a national o\ufb03ce in the MAA, she was\na member of the executive committee (1919) and then chairman (1931\u201332) of the\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBACON - 3\n\nMaryland-District of Columbia-Virginia Section. She was president of the Baltimore\nchapter of the AAUP and of the College Club (the Baltimore branch of AAUW), and\nserved for many years on the College Entrance Examination Board. She was also a\nmember of the Equal Su\ufb00rage League of Baltimore, the Foreign Policy Association,\nthe League of Women Voters, and the Daughters of the American Revolution. In\n1937 she reported that she was a member of the Methodist Episcopal Church and\n\u201cseveral associations for peace\u201d (Owens questionnaire). Bacon was an avid traveler,\nwho had traveled with her sister, Agnes, before Agnes\u2019s death in 1930. After Bacon\u2019s\nretirement she ful\ufb01lled a promise to Agnes to travel again, and she visited England,\nItaly, Egypt, and Palestine during a \ufb01fteen-month trip abroad.\n\nAfter an illness of a year, Clara Bacon died in the Baltimore home she had\nshared with her mother and sister until their deaths. She had been an active church\nmember, and her funeral service was held in the First Methodist Church, which\nwas near the house on Calvert Street in which she had lived for \ufb01fty years. She is\nburied in Cherry Grove Cemetery near Abingdon, Illinois.

      "text": "CARLSON, Elizabeth. October 2, 1896\u2013November 1, 2000.\nUniversity of Minnesota (BA 1917, MA 1918, PhD 1924).\n\nSally Elizabeth Carlson was born in Minneapolis, Minnesota, the third of \ufb01ve\nsurviving children of six born to Alice (Alise) (Johnson) (1870\u20131956) and Carl Emil\nCarlson (1858\u20131950). Both of her parents were born in Sweden and emigrated sev-\neral years before their marriage in 1891. Her mother had an elementary school\neducation, and her father had no formal education, although he was literate in\nSwedish and English. He was a stone mason in Minneapolis. Her eldest brother,\nOscar E. (1892\u20131958), was a salesman, having had some high school and business\ncollege, while her next oldest brother, A. Paul (1894\u20131973), was an electrical engi-\nneer with a BS in engineering. Her sister, Esther A. (1904\u20131975), with a high school\nand Bible school education, served forty-six years as a missionary to Venezuela, and\nher youngest brother, Cli\ufb00ord N. (1907\u20131939), was a lawyer.\n\nIn 1913 Carlson graduated as valedictorian from South High School in Minneapo-\nlis and remained in that city for her collegiate and most of her professional career\nat the University of Minnesota. Even though her parents were not supportive of\nher desire for a college education, she received her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1917 and\nher master\u2019s degree in 1918, after which she taught at McIntosh High School in\nnorthern Minnesota for nine months. She was an instructor of mathematics and\nphysics at Knox College in Illinois during 1919\u201320. Carlson returned to the Univer-\nsity of Minnesota in 1920 where she was a teaching assistant in mathematics her\n\ufb01rst year and remained an assistant until she received her PhD four years later. She\nand Carey Morgan Jensen (a male) received the \ufb01rst two PhD\u2019s in mathematics at\nMinnesota in 1924, both as students of Dunham Jackson in analysis and both with\nminors in physics.\n\nElizabeth Carlson remained at Minnesota until her retirement as professor emer-\nitus in June 1965. She was instructor 1924\u201328, assistant professor 1928\u201350, associate\nprofessor 1950\u201363, and professor 1963\u201365, a pattern very similar to that of Gladys\nGibbens, her slightly older colleague. Carlson taught at Hunter College in the sum-\nmer session of 1930, having exchanged positions with a faculty member from there.\nIn the fall of 1965, just after her retirement, she taught at Macalaster College as\na visiting professor. During her career at Minnesota she taught elementary and\nadvanced undergraduate courses, was advisor for a number of MA candidates, and\nwon a Distinguished Teacher Award in 1962. In the late 1930s, she joined with\nRaymond W. Brink and Ella Thorp, who together had earlier published a book of\nexercises for trigonometry, in producing a set of exercises for Minnesota\u2019s interme-\ndiate algebra course. She also taught a reading course for advanced mathematics\nstudents during the summers, sometimes with other faculty and sometimes alone.\nCarlson published three papers based on her dissertation, two in the Transactions\nof the AMS and one in the Bulletin of the AMS. Two decades after she retired,\nshe wrote that she \u201cconsidered being a good teacher more important than any\nmathematical research [she] might do\u201d (Smithsonian questionnaire 1985). She was\nactive in the mathematical community through the early 1960s; she was an associate\neditor of the American Mathematical Monthly 1927\u201331, served on the executive\ncommittee of the Minnesota Section of the MAA 1961\u201362, and refereed for the\nMonthly in 1962.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCARLSON - 2\n\nCarlson was an active member of the Evangelical Free Church of America and\nhelped start the Central Evangelical Free Church in downtown Minneapolis. She\ntaught Sunday school, was deaconess, and sang in the choir and in a mixed quartet\nat the Central Evangelical Free Church, which is now closed. She served as faculty\nadvisor for the Minnesota Christian Fellowship and for the Inter-Varsity Christian\nFellowship chapter at the University of Minnesota and was active in the faculty\nBible class. She also conducted Bible studies in her home and elsewhere, especially\nafter her retirement. Carlson traveled extensively throughout the world and retained\nher \ufb02uency in Swedish.\n\nWarren Loud, a former colleague of Carlson, reported to one of the authors in\nan e-mail message on March 3, 1998, that \u201cshe was strong and vigorous right up\nto retirement and beyond. As an undergraduate she lived about three miles from\ncampus and always walked both ways every day, (not an easy thing in a Minneapolis\nwinter!) although when I knew her, she drove to and from the university. I recall\nmeeting her in downtown Minneapolis in 1984, when she was eighty-eight. She said\nshe was doing an errand for one of the older ladies in her retirement home.\u201d\n\nElizabeth Carlson died at the Augustana Home of Minneapolis at age 104 in\nNovember 2000.

      "text": "BUCK, Elsie (McFarland). June 3, 1897\u2013January 11, 1984.\nUniversity of California (BA 1917, MA 1918, PhD 1920).\n\nElsie Jeannette McFarland was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the only child of\nLillian (Hope) (b. 1867) and Francis W. McFarland (b. 1863), Missouri natives.\nThey had married in about 1896 and moved by 1900 to San Francisco, California,\nwhere Frank McFarland was a clerk in a pension o\ufb03ce. In 1910 the family was\nliving in Covina, in southern California, and Francis McFarland was a high school\nteacher. In 1920 they were in Berkeley and he was a clerk.\n\nElsie McFarland attended high school in Covina and Pasadena, California, before\ndoing all of her undergraduate and graduate work at the University of California\nin Berkeley. She was a member of Alpha Phi social sorority as an undergraduate.\nAfter graduating in 1917, she began her graduate work and received her master\u2019s\ndegree in 1918. She was a university fellow in mathematics 1918\u201319 and an assistant\nin mathematics 1919\u201320 before receiving her doctorate in 1920 with minor subject\nphysics. In September 1920 she presented her dissertation as the \ufb01rst speaker at\nthe university\u2019s newly organized women\u2019s mathematical honor society, Mu Theta\nEpsilon.\n\nThe next two years McFarland taught mathematics and physics at high schools in\nCalifornia; she was at Maryville High School 1920\u201321 and at Newman High School\n1921\u201322. During the years 1922\u201325 McFarland taught as a part-time instructor\nat three schools in the San Francisco area: the University of California 1922\u201325,\nDominican College in San Rafael 1922\u201324, and Mills College 1924\u201325.\n\nIn 1925 McFarland moved to the University of Oklahoma as an instructor and\nwas promoted to assistant professor in 1927. She resigned her position at Oklahoma\nin 1931 for personal reasons. She was living with her parents, who it appears had\nmoved with her to Norman, Oklahoma. She was a visiting PhD at the University\nof Chicago in the summer of 1931.\n\nMcFarland then moved to Spokane, Washington. In November 1980 she re\ufb02ected\non her situation in an interview conducted by Don Haacke for an oral history project\nat Boise State University. \u201cI was teaching and semi-starving at a very small college\nin Spokane, known as Spokane University. . . . At any rate, we were not getting paid\nvery much money. I [taught] my whole nine months there for $360 and a box of\napples and some kitchen cleanser donated by one of the students as part of his\ntuition. And I was sending out something like 300 or 400 letters of application all\nover the country. This was in 1932 . . . when jobs were very few and far between\u201d (p.\n1). McFarland then learned that a junior college was to be opened by the Episcopal\nChurch in Boise, Idaho, on the site of St. Margaret\u2019s Hall, a school for girls run by\nthe church.\n\nMcFarland joined the \ufb01rst faculty of eight at the new Boise Junior College as\na teacher of mathematics and German that fall of 1932, at triple her previous\nsalary plus room, board, and laundry. After two years the church withdrew its\n\ufb01nancial support, and the possibility that the school would close loomed so large\nthat McFarland again sent out applications and accepted a job at Jones County\nJunior College, a combined agricultural high school and junior college in Ellisville,\nMississippi. She was there 1934\u201337 before accepting an invitation from the new\npresident of the still surviving Boise Junior College to return and teach mathematics\nand German.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBUCK - 2\n\nInitially McFarland taught all the mathematics at the school and later was the\nranking member in mathematics within the Physical Science Division. Her teaching\nof veterans after World War II was among the most satisfying of her career. In her\nNovember 21, 1980, interview she noted that \u201cexcept for the \ufb01rst two-year students\nat the beginning of the junior college, I never had a nicer group of people than\nthe veterans. I had big classes; we might have, maybe, a calculus class of 45 or 50\nstudents, the room packed with them. The nicest, most cooperative people to work\nwith. They knew what they wanted, they\u2019d been out in the war, they were back in\nschool, they knew what they wanted to do\u201d (p. 13). She also served on many college\ncommittees including those concerned with scholarship standards, scholarship loans\nand grants-in-aid, and curriculum.\n\nWhen McFarland originally moved to Boise, her parents accompanied her. In\n1947 she married Roy M. Buck, a civil engineer, who died in 1952. She retired from\nthe college as professor emeritus in 1968, three years after it was granted four-year\nstatus and renamed Boise College (now Boise State University). She taught an\noccasional course after her retirement.\n\nElsie M. Buck loved music and played clarinet in the college orchestra for many\nyears. She also purchased and played a grand piano in a room in her home built\nto accommodate it. She and a friend made frequent trips to San Francisco for the\nopera. She belonged to the faculty women\u2019s bridge club for nearly \ufb01fty years. She\nwas active in, and served as president of, the Altrusa Club and was a member of the\nEpiscopal church in Boise. She was fond of animals, especially cats; loved to garden;\nand owned a small cabin outside of Boise where she spent time in the summer.\n\nElsie McFarland Buck died of heart failure in a Boise, Idaho, hospital at eighty-\nsix in 1984. Services were conducted at All Saints Episcopal Church, and she was\nburied in Morris Hill Cemetery in Boise. She was survived by two step-children and\na cousin.

      "text": "FRY, Cleota G. December 30, 1910\u2013July 1, 2001.\nReed College (BA 1933), Purdue University (MS 1936, PhD 1939).\n\nCleota Gage Fry was born in Shoshone, Idaho, the eldest of four children of\nCoral (Gage) (1891\u20131959), born in Mitchell, South Dakota, and Holmes L. Fry\n(1878\u20131968), originally of Davenport, Iowa. Her parents were married on January\n12, 1910. Her mother, with a grade school education, was a housewife; her father,\nwho had completed high school, was a machinist. Her younger siblings were Gladys\nViola (1912\u20131977), born in Dietrich, Idaho; Russell (1919\u20131944), born in Portland,\nOregon, and killed in action in World War II, having completed one semester of\ncollege before entering the service; and Eathel Irene (1921\u20131993), also born in Port-\nland. Both sisters were educated through high school and married.\n\nFry\u2019s early, secondary, and undergraduate schooling was in Portland, where she\ngraduated from Roosevelt High School in 1929. She then attended Reed College,\nhaving borrowed money from a lawyer friend, and graduated, probably as a physics\nmajor, in 1933. Her undergraduate thesis in the Division of Mathematics and Nat-\nural Sciences was \u201cAnalysis of textile \ufb01bers and fabrics.\u201d\n\nAn undated letter from Fry to her Reed College physics professor, A. A. Knowl-\nton, sent sometime in 1955 summarizes her activities after her graduation from\nReed.\n\nLate in October [1933], I climbed aboard a U[nion] P[aci\ufb01c] train\nheaded east and got o\ufb00 in Chicago. Vivian [Johnson, a Reed College\nfriend] met me, and we took in the World\u2019s Fair. I came down to\nLafayette, Indiana. Since I could live with Vivian I started sitting\nin on graduate courses in mathematics and physics. In February I\nsecured a part time job helping Dr. R. B. Abbott on his research\non violins. I registered for 10 hours of course work and thereby\nlaunched my graduate study. I continued helping on the research\nprogram to \ufb01nd out what makes a violin good. To earn a little\nmore money, I also tutored.\n\nI wrote a master\u2019s thesis on atomic form factors under Dr. Nord-\nheim. The M.S. degree was granted in February 1936. There being\nnothing else to do, I started to work on a Ph.D. I changed from\nphysics to mathematics as a major in the fall of 1937 because my\nthesis problem fell through since most of the work was published\n[the] previous summer. (letter in author\u2019s possession courtesy of\nRuby A. Pardue)\n\nIn 1939 Fry received her doctorate in mathematics with a minor in physics, having\nwritten a dissertation in analysis under the direction of H. K. Hughes. Her PhD\nwas the second in mathematics given by Purdue, the \ufb01rst having been awarded in\n1893.\n\nFry remained at Purdue for her entire career, teaching at various times both\nmathematics and physics. She was an assistant instructor of mathematics 1939\u201340\nand an instructor of physics 1941\u201345. During the war years she taught elementary\nand intermediate physics and was in charge of the physics laboratory. She also\norganized intensive physics courses for high school students.\n\nThe rest of her career at Purdue she was in the mathematics department: as in-\nstructor 1945\u201347, assistant professor 1947\u201355, and associate professor 1955\u201377. Her\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nFRY - 2\n\nteaching consisted of mathematics courses from the freshman through the gradu-\nate level. In the late 1940s, she was appointed faculty advisor to the mathematics\nmajors. In the period 1952\u201361 she was also assistant to the dean in the School of\nScience. Fry coauthored a college mathematics textbook in 1952. In the mid-1950s\nshe taught in a summer program for high school teachers set up by the General\nElectric Company. She also helped with Purdue\u2019s sci-math assembly, where high\nschool students contribute projects and short papers, and with Purdue\u2019s spring\nregional Science Fair. She served on university and departmental committees and\nwas secretary to the faculty of the School of Science, Education, and Humanities\nfor at least three years in the early 1950s. She also served on examining committees\nfor master\u2019s degree candidates, and preliminary and \ufb01nal examinations for PhD\ncandidates.\n\nIn Fry\u2019s 1955 letter to Knowlton she wrote, \u201cVivian has told you about our house\nwhich we built together and the trips we take every summer. We occasionally knock\na golf ball around Purdue\u2019s two courses. The scores are astronomical. The rest of\nthe time we get our exercise by yard work.\u201d She also wrote, \u201cThe academic life and\nwork seems to agree with me. Anyway I like it.\u201d Vivian A. Johnson was a member\nof the physics department at Purdue; she retired in 1979 and died in 1985. Their\ntrips included a seven-month trip around the world.\n\nFry\u2019s next-door neighbor described Fry as not even \ufb01ve feet tall, with curly hair\nand delicate features, a \u201craving beauty.\u201d She said Fry was sweet, happy, and laughed\na lot.\n\nCleota Fry died at ninety in 2001 in the St. Elizabeth Medical Center in Lafayette,\nIndiana. She had had a heart attack a few days earlier and chose not to have open\nheart surgery. There is a Cleota Gage Fry scholarship, a need-based scholarship at\nReed College, as the result of an annuity purchased by Fry.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, APS, Sigma Xi.\n\nDissertation:\n1939 Asymptotic developments of certain integral functions.

November 6, 1886\u2013March 7, 1982.\nSmith College (BA 1908), Yale University (PhD 1911).\n\nIda Barney was born in New Haven, Connecticut, the \ufb01rst of two daughters\nof Ida (Bushnell) (1858\u20131941) and Samuel Eben Barney (1859\u20131940), natives of\nConnecticut who married in 1884. Her father was born in New Haven, graduated\nfrom the She\ufb03eld Scienti\ufb01c School of Yale University in 1879, served as a consultant\non various engineering projects, and was on the civil engineering faculty at Yale\nfrom 1882 until his retirement in 1924. Her sister, Elizabeth Hunt (1894\u20131958),\ngraduated from Smith College in 1914 and was secretary to the dean, and later to\nthe registrar, of the Yale Divinity School.\n\nIda Barney attended New Haven High School 1900\u201304, Smith College 1904\u201308,\nand Yale Graduate School 1908\u201311. She was a mathematics major at Smith, where\nher studies included a course in general astronomy and one in the theory and use\nof transit instruments in addition to various ones in geometry, calculus, theory of\nequations, history of mathematics, and real and complex variables. Her courses\nat Yale included, among others, advanced theory of functions, elliptic functions,\nAbelian functions, and abstract thermodynamics, all from James Pierpont, who\nalso directed her dissertation. She received her PhD from Yale in 1911.\n\nAfter Barney \ufb01nished her graduate work, she spent the next ten years on various\nmathematics faculties, starting as professor of mathematics at Rollins College in\nWinter Park, Florida, 1911\u201312. She was at Smith College for six years: as an assis-\ntant 1912\u201313, as instructor 1913\u201317, and as assistant professor 1920\u201321. Between\nher two periods of time at Smith, she was professor \ufb01rst at Lake Erie College in\nPainesville, Ohio, 1917\u201319, and then at Meredith College in Raleigh, North Car-\nolina, 1919\u201320, where she was the only member of the department. All but Rollins\nCollege were women\u2019s colleges at the time.\n\nBarney spent the rest of her life in or around New Haven, where she and her\nsister lived with their parents until their parents\u2019 deaths in the early 1940s. After\nthat Ida Barney and her sister lived in the family home until her sister\u2019s death in\n1958.\n\nIn 1921 Barney enrolled in a graduate course in astronomy at Yale, and the\nfollowing year she was appointed research assistant at the Yale Observatory. She\ntook additional graduate courses in astronomy in 1922 and 1928. Early in her tenure\nat the observatory she became involved in a major star mapping project under\nthe direction of Frank Schlesinger. This project, cataloguing positions and proper\nmotions of stars, was done with the participation of the Lick Observatory of the\nUniversity of California, the US Naval Observatory, and the Royal Observatories at\nGreenwich and the Cape of Good Hope. Barney was coauthor with Schlesinger, and\nsometimes others, of twelve volumes of catalogues that appeared in the Transactions\nof the Astronomical Observatory of Yale University. The \ufb01rst six of these volumes,\nappearing 1925 though 1934, were produced before IBM punch-card machines were\nused to facilitate computations.\n\nAfter Frank Schlesinger\u2019s retirement in 1941, Barney was named director of the\nproject. Between 1945 and 1950 she authored another eight volumes of catalogues.\nIn 1949 she was promoted to research associate in astronomy, with the rank of\nassociate professor, for a \ufb01ve-year term. When the project was completed in 1950\nit resulted in what is known as the Yale Photographic Zone catalogues. In 1951\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBARNEY - 2\n\nthrough 1954 Barney authored a supplementary volume and two revised catalogues.\nShe also coauthored three new catalogues, one in 1954 and two in 1959, four years\nafter her retirement.\n\nBarney was recognized by her colleagues for her achievements. In 1945 the Amer-\nican Astronomical Society created a council, and the following year Barney was\nelected to a three-year term on it. She was a fellow of the Royal Astronomical Soci-\nety of London. In 1952 Barney was awarded the Annie J. Cannon Prize, established\nin 1934 and given no more often than every three years, by the American Astronom-\nical Society. According to an item in the April 1953 issue of the Publications of the\nAstronomical Society of the Paci\ufb01c, \u201cMiss Barney was cited for her work on the . . .\nYale Photographic Zone Catalogue, which required a half-million measurements and\ntwenty-three years of computation work before it was completed in 1950\u201d (65:99).\nA letter to the editor of Sky and Telescope after Barney\u2019s death in 1982 quoted Dirk\nBrouwer, director of the Yale Observatory 1941\u201366, concerning her receipt of the\nprize: \u201cIt seems especially \ufb01tting that the prize named for a woman who classi\ufb01ed\na half-million spectra should be given to one who made approximately the same\nnumber of measures for the positions and motions of stars.\u201d\n\nIda Barney continued to live in the family house in New Haven for several years.\nShe had no immediate survivors at the time of her death in an assisted living facility\nin Hamden, Connecticut, just outside New Haven, at age ninety-\ufb01ve in 1982. She\nis buried in the family plot in the Grove Street Cemetery in New Haven.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA (charter member), Amer. Astron. Soc., Inter-\nnat. Astron. Union, Roy. Astron.

May 20, 1865\u2013May 12, 1943.\nMount Holyoke College (BA 1902), Yale University (PhD 1904).\n\nClara Eliza Smith was born in Northford, Connecticut, the only child of Geor-\ngiana (Smith) (b. 1834) and Edward Smith (1832\u20131894), a farmer and cabinet maker\nin Northford. She was educated with private tutors and entered Mount Holyoke Fe-\nmale Seminary in 1882. She graduated in 1885, four years before the \ufb01rst bachelor\u2019s\ndegree was awarded by Mount Holyoke and eight years before its present name was\nadopted. Letters from this period of her life have been deposited in the Mount\nHolyoke College library.\n\nSmith attended the Yale School of the Fine Arts 1886\u201387 and 1888\u201389 after\nwhich she was a teacher of drawing and assistant in mathematics at the Blooms-\nburg Literary Institute and State Normal School (now Bloomsburg University of\nPennsylvania) for eight years, 1889\u201397.\n\nSmith entered the Yale graduate school in 1901 to study mathematics. At that\npoint she had taken plane and solid geometry and plane and spherical trigonometry\nas requirements for her graduation from Mount Holyoke Seminary. She also studied\nhigher algebra, analytic geometry, and calculus on her own. Smith was awarded a\nbachelor\u2019s degree from Mount Holyoke College in 1902 after passing an exam on\none year\u2019s additional work in French and on the presentation of a certi\ufb01cate from\nYale for courses in mathematics. Her graduate work at Yale in 1901\u201302 was in\nvector analysis with J. W. Gibbs, di\ufb00erential equations and function theory with J.\nP. Pierpont, di\ufb00erential geometry with W. A. Granville, and projective geometry\nwith E. B. Wilson. The next year she had theory of functions of a complex variable\nwith Pierpont, advanced analytic geometry with P. F. Smith, higher algebra with H.\nE. Hawkes, partial di\ufb00erential equations with E. R. Hedrick, and transformations of\nspace with A. G. Gale. In 1903\u201304 she took theory of functions of a real variable with\nPierpont, continuous groups with Smith, and elliptic functions with Hawkes. Clara\nSmith wrote her dissertation under the direction of James Pierpont, a native of\nNew Haven, who had gone to Yale after several years of study in Europe, especially\nin Berlin and in Vienna, where he received his PhD in 1894.\n\nClara Smith received her PhD in 1904 and remained at Yale as a reader in\nmathematics for two years, after which she was an acting instructor at Wellesley\nCollege 1906\u201307. The following year she was an instructor at The Western College\nfor Women in Oxford, Ohio. In 1908 she returned to Wellesley as assistant and,\nexcept for leaves, spent the rest of her career there. She was an instructor 1909\u2013\n14, associate professor 1914\u201324, professor 1924\u201334, (some years as the Helen Day\nGould Professor), and emeritus professor after her retirement in 1934. She had three\nleaves of absence: in 1911\u201312, during which she traveled, attended the September\n1911 meeting of the German mathematical society, and studied one semester at\nthe university in G\u00a8ottingen; in 1918\u201319, when she was an exchange professor at\nGoucher College; and in 1926\u201327, when she made a trip around the world.\n\nWhile at Wellesley, Smith coauthored two books with Helen A. Merrill; the \ufb01rst\nwas \u201cprepared for use in a required \ufb01rst-year course in Wellesley College\u201d (p. iii) and\nwas printed in 1914, and the second was published in 1917. Merrill was a long-time\nWellesley faculty member who had earned her PhD from Yale a year before Smith,\nand who chaired the mathematics department from 1916 until her retirement in\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSMITH - 2\n\n1932. Smith was department chair for the following two years, 1932\u201334, before her\nown retirement.\n\nClara Smith served in a number of ways on the College Entrance Examination\nBoard: as a reader starting in 1919, on a committee on revision, and on a board\nof examiners. She became a life member of the AMS, was permanent secretary of\nthe membership committee during the 1920s, and was a trustee on the original\nboard of the AMS in 1927, a thirty-one member body formed at the time of its\nincorporation. Smith and Anna J. Pell (Wheeler) of Bryn Mawr College were the\nonly women on the board. Smith was a charter member of the MAA, served as\na trustee 1923\u201325, and was vice president 1927. In a resolution voted on by the\nboard of trustees at the annual meeting of the MAA, December 31, 1924\u2013January\n1, 1925, she was singled out for the e\ufb00orts she made while she was in charge of\na joint committee on membership of the AMS and the MAA. Her work for the\nAMS was also recognized in a resolution of the council in September 1925 and\nin one of several \u201cresolutions on deaths of persons who have been prominent in\nthe work of the Society\u201d (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 49:827). That resolution read in\npart, \u201cMuch of the success of [the membership committee] was due to her laborious\nand painstaking assembling of data regarding teachers of college mathematics. On\nbehalf of the Society, the Council wishes to acknowledge her loving interest in its\nwelfare\u201d (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 49:828).\n\nSmith was a member of the Congregational Church. In 1923 she described her\nhobbies as \u201ctramping and outdoor sports.\u201d In July 1927, she was severely injured\nin an automobile accident. A news item from February 21, 1935, noted that Lennie\nPhoebe Copeland and Clara Eliza Smith, retired head of the mathematics depart-\nment, \u201csailed last week from New York for travel in the near east including Egypt,\nPalestine, Syria, Uganda, Turkey, Greece, and Italy\u201d (Lennie P. Copeland folder,\nWellesley College Archives). They were due back in June. Smith and Copeland, her\nlong-time friend and colleague in the mathematics department, shared a home in\nWellesley from the early 1920s. In her response to a request for information from\nHelen Owens in 1937, Copeland noted that she would be spending the summer \u201con\nMiss Smith\u2019s farm in the hills of Connecticut.\u201d They both attended the Septem-\nber 1937 AMS meeting in State College, Pennsylvania, where Smith was one of\nthree guests of honor at a luncheon organized by Owens that was \u201cheld in honor of\nthe women who were pioneers in mathematical research in America\u201d (Bull. Amer.\nMath. Soc. 43:747).\n\nIn May 1943, shortly before her seventy-eighth birthday, Clara Eliza Smith died\nof a cerebral hemorrhage at her home in Wellesley.

October 15, 1902\u2013July 7, 1991.\nVassar College (BA 1924), Radcliffe College (MA 1929, PhD 1934).\n\nNancy Cole was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the only child of Gertrude\n(Groce) (1870\u20131949) and Albert Henry Cole (1868\u20131925), both of Massachusetts.\nAncestors of her mother had come to Plymouth on the May\ufb02ower in 1620; those of\nher father had come to Plymouth in 1630. Her mother, a normal school graduate,\nand her father, a high school graduate, were married in 1898. Her father was in the\ngrocery business.\n\nCole graduated from high school in Plymouth, Massachusetts, in 1919 and stud-\nied there as a post-graduate an additional year before entering Jackson College, the\ncoordinate women\u2019s college associated with Tufts College (now University) at that\ntime. She was at Jackson College with a Whiting scholarship 1920\u201322. She then\nattended Vassar College for two years and received her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1924.\nFrom 1924 to 1926, Cole taught algebra and geometry to students preparing for\ncollege at the Oxford School in Hartford, Connecticut. In 1926\u201327 she studied at\nRadcli\ufb00e College, and the following year she taught at Vassar as an instructor. Cole\nstudied at Radcli\ufb00e 1928\u201329 while also working as a tutor there. She received her\nmaster\u2019s degree in 1929 and continued as a student at Radcli\ufb00e with scholarship\nassistance through 1931. In 1930 she and her widowed mother were living in Cam-\nbridge, Massachusetts, although they maintained the family home in Plymouth.\n\nCole was an instructor at Wells College 1931\u201332. On February 20, 1933, she\nreplied to a note from Eugenie Morenus who had inquired about her interest in a\nposition at Sweet Briar College. Cole wrote, \u201cI am in Plymouth this winter, writing\nmy thesis and working on Professor Morse\u2019s Colloquium Lectures on the Calculus\nof Variations in the Large. Perhaps I have told you before, that for the latter I do\nthe typing, \ufb01ll in the formulae, and check the mathematics\u201d (Faculty Files, Sweet\nBriar College Archives). Morse was also her dissertation advisor.\n\nIn the fall of 1933, Cole took a position as instructor at Sweet Briar College in\nVirginia, where, except for leaves, she remained for a decade. She replaced Ethel\nMoody, a 1930 Cornell PhD who left Sweet Briar for a position at Pennsylvania\nState College. The department head at Sweet Briar was Eugenie Morenus, a 1922\nColumbia PhD who had been at Sweet Briar since 1909.\n\nOver the two-year period 1932\u201334 Cole \ufb01nished her graduate requirements and\nreceived her PhD from Radcli\ufb00e in 1934. She served as acting department head at\nSweet Briar in 1934\u201335 and in 1941\u201342. While teaching at Sweet Briar, Cole was a\nmember of the Virginia Academy of Science. She also regularly attended meetings\nof the AMS, a practice she continued until about 1950.\n\nCole began a leave from Sweet Briar in February 1943 to take a wartime ap-\npointment as visiting assistant professor and then visiting associate professor at\nKenyon College in Gambier, Ohio. Her \ufb01rst full year at Kenyon, she was lecturer\nand teacher in mathematics in the Pre-Meteorology Program for the Army Air\nForce, and was a teacher in the Army Specialized Training Program from February\nuntil July 1944.\n\nNancy Cole resigned from Sweet Briar in May 1944 and after leaving Kenyon was\nassistant professor at Connecticut College for Women 1944\u201347. In 1947 she took a\nposition as assistant professor at Syracuse University, where she was to remain the\nrest of her career. Ruth Wyckli\ufb00e Stokes, who had earned a PhD from Duke in 1931,\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCOLE, N. - 2\n\nhad joined the faculty at Syracuse the previous year, also as assistant professor. At\nSyracuse, Cole was assistant professor 1947\u201352, associate professor 1952\u201371, and\nassociate professor emeritus after her retirement in 1971. In addition to her stan-\ndard undergraduate teaching, Cole taught courses in \ufb01nance, statistics, probability,\nstatics, dynamics, vector analysis, and higher mathematics for engineers and physi-\ncists to undergraduates and some graduate students, and calculus of variations to\ngraduate students. In March 1980 she was called back to take over an advanced cal-\nculus class when a colleague died suddenly. She reported that it was \u201ca stimulating\nexperience after nine years of retirement!\u201d (Smithsonian questionnaire 1985).\n\nIn her 1985 questionnaire Cole also reported that her interest in mathematics\nwas stimulated \ufb01rst by her high school geometry teacher Lucia Richardson; then\nby Tufts professor Edith L. Bush; by the chair of the mathematics department at\nVassar, Henry Seely White; and by the several Harvard faculty members with whom\nshe studied while doing her graduate work at Radcli\ufb00e.\n\nCole was a reader of the mathematical attainment test for the College Entrance\nExam Board 1938\u201341 and served on the promotion and services committee of the\nAssociation of Mathematics Teachers of New York State 1958\u201365. She also held\nvarious o\ufb03ces with the Syracuse chapters of Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, and Sigma\nDelta Epsilon. For the twenty-year period before her retirement, Cole was the per-\nmanent faculty secretary of the local chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon, the national math-\nematics honor society, which was founded in 1914 at Syracuse.\n\nCole traveled extensively and attended the International Congresses of Math-\nematicians in Oslo (1936); Cambridge, Massachusetts (1950); Edinburgh (1958);\nStockholm (1962); Nice (1970); Vancouver, British Columbia (1974); Helsinki (1978);\nand Berkeley (1986). In 1983 she traveled to the People\u2019s Republic of China as a\nmember of a delegation of American university mathematics education specialists\norganized by People-to-People International to participate in a bilateral technical\nexchange with their Chinese professional counterparts.\n\nIn 1985 Cole described her political a\ufb03liation as Independent and her hobbies\nas hiking and swimming. From 1950 she was a\ufb03liated with the Foundation for\nChristian Living, now the Peale Center for Christian Living, in Pawling, New York.\nShe was also a member of the Antiquarian Society of Plymouth, Massachusetts,\nfrom before 1950 and of the Pilgrim Society in Plymouth after 1961.\n\nNancy Cole died of a heart attack in her home in Plymouth, Massachusetts, at\nthe age of eighty-eight in 1991. She was survived by a cousin and three second\ncousins. A memorial service was held at the Chiltonville Congregational Church\nin Plymouth.

      "text": "MAYER, Joanna Isabel. March 6, 1904\u2013February 28, 1991.\nDominican College of San Rafael (BA 1927), Marquette University (MA 1928,\nPhD 1931).\n\nJoanna Isabel Mayer was born in Pettis County, near Sedalia, Missouri, the\nthird of \ufb01ve children of Anna (Poinsignon) (1871\u20131960) and Edward John Mayer\n(ca. 1869\u20131941), both born in Missouri. Her parents, of farm families, continued to\nfarm after their marriage in Sedalia in about 1897. Her siblings were Emil Joseph\n(1898\u20131967), Mary Helen (Ella) (1902\u20131981), Francis Nicholas (1906\u20131995), and\nElizabeth (1909\u20131989). Census records indicate that in 1910 the family was living\nin Dresden Township, near Sedalia, Missouri, and Edward Mayer was a farmer;\nin 1920 the family was living in Portland, Oregon, where he was a farmer and a\nlaborer; in 1930 they were living in Salina, Kansas. No occupation was indicated\nfor her father, but Joanna Mayer was listed as a parochial school teacher.\n\nLetters written in 1984 and 1985, when Joanna Mayer was about eighty years\nold, describe her family\u2019s many moves and the schools she attended before she\nentered college. There is also sketchy material about places she lived and jobs she\nheld. It has been impossible to con\ufb01rm all of the details.\n\nIt appears that the only schools she attended were Catholic schools, and later\nshe only taught in such schools. She \ufb01rst attended the Sacred Heart school in\nSedalia, Missouri. In about 1917 the family moved to Hollywood, California, where\nshe and Ella attended Cathedral High School. After the \u201cgreat \ufb02u\u201d they moved to\nPhoenix, Arizona, where her father and brother sold cars. They moved back to Los\nAngeles, from there to San Jose, and then to Portland, Oregon, for a year. It has\nbeen con\ufb01rmed that she was in the \ufb01rst academic class at St. Mary\u2019s Academy in\nPortland during the school year 1919\u201320, when she was \ufb01fteen years old. Joanna\nMayer reported that the family then moved to Seattle, then brie\ufb02y to Spokane, and\nthen to Kansas City, Missouri, where she went to Loretto High School, a Catholic\ngirls\u2019 school. They moved to Florida and ended up in Nashville, Tennessee, where\nshe went to St. Bernard\u2019s High School. From there they moved to Kansas City and\nthen to Salt Lake City, and back to San Jose, in the San Francisco Bay area, where,\nwith some interruptions, she and some members of her family were to spend much\nof the remainder of their lives.\n\nAccording to records at Dominican College in San Rafael, California, Joanna\nMayer graduated from Notre Dame High School in San Jose before entering Do-\nminican College for her undergraduate work. Apparently the family \ufb01rst lived in\nOakland and then in San Rafael while she attended college. Mayer indicated that\nshe started to study mathematics while in Oakland and started to major in mathe-\nmatics her second year in college. In May 1927 Mayer received her BA degree from\nDominican College with a major in mathematics and a minor in philosophy. While\nthere she was in\ufb02uenced by Anna Marie Whelan, who taught at Dominican 1925\u201327\nbefore moving to a position at Hunter College.\n\nMayer\u2019s older sister, Mary Helen Mayer, also attended Dominican College in\nSan Rafael and earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1926. She earned a master\u2019s degree\nfrom Marquette University in Milwaukee, Wisconsin, in 1928 with a thesis, \u201cThe\nEducational Theories of St. Thomas Aquinas.\u201d It appears from correspondence with\nJoanna Mayer that her sister Mary Helen taught at Dominican College for a while.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMAYER - 2\n\nHer youngest sister received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Clarke College, a Catholic\ncollege in Dubuque, Iowa, in 1932.\n\nMayer entered Marquette University graduate school in 1927 and remained en-\nrolled until 1931; she received the MA degree in June 1928. In the preface to her\nmaster\u2019s thesis she wrote, \u201cThe choice from the \ufb01eld of Invariants of a topic for a\nthesis grew out of an interest in the subject which my major Professor at Dominican\nCollege, San Rafael, California, inspired in the last course I had the privilege of tak-\ning from her. To Dr. Anne Marie Whelan, then, I owe my \ufb01rst acknowledgment of\ngratitude.\u201d Mayer\u2019s election to membership in the MAA was announced in the June\n1930 issue of the Monthly, and her position, presumably for the 1929\u201330 academic\nyear, was described as head of the department at Marymount College in Salina,\nKansas, where she and her parents were living. In June 1931 she received her PhD,\nthe \ufb01rst awarded by Marquette in mathematics. Her dissertation was directed by\nH. P. Pettit, who had also directed her master\u2019s thesis.\n\nMayer\u2019s dissertation begins:\n\nRuth Gentry introduces her dissertation On the Forms of Plane\nQuartic Curves as follows:\n\n\u201cMany papers dealing with curves of the fourth order, or\nQuartic Curves, are to be found in the various mathemat-\nical periodicals; but these leave the actual appearance of\nthe curve as a whole so largely to the reader\u2019s imagina-\ntion that it is here proposed to give a complete enumer-\nation of the fundamental forms of Plane Quartic Curves\nas they appear when projected so as to cut the line in\ufb01n-\nity the least possible number of times . . . , together with\nevidence that the forms presented can exist.\u201d\n\nIt is the purpose of my dissertation to show whether it is possible to\nderive, and how to construct, all of the forms proposed in Gentry\u2019s\ndissertation by the method used by Doctor H. P. Pettit in his\n\u201cProjective Description of Some Higher Plane Curves.\u201d\n\nMayer\u2019s dissertation ends with a description of those curves enumerated by Gentry\nthat she succeeded in generating.\n\nJoanna Mayer\u2019s name appears on the November 1931 MAA membership list with\nan address in Sedalia, Missouri. By some time in 1932 she is apparently a teacher\nin San Jose, California. In 1937\u201338, Joanna Mayer was an instructor at Seton Hill\nCollege (now Seton Hill University), a Catholic school in Greensburg, Pennsylvania,\nand at that time a women\u2019s college. Articles in the Seton Hill alumnae magazine\nand the student newspaper indicate that she was there to replace a faculty member\non leave for the year for graduate study. They report that she had come from San\nFrancisco College for Women, a Catholic college in California that is now closed,\nand that she had previously taught at Saint Mary-of-the-Woods and at Clarke\nCollege. In a March 15, 1938, article, \u201cPlease! Dr. Mayer is Math Professor, Not\na Freshman!,\u201d in the Setonian, the Seton Hill student newspaper, she is described\nas \u201cbrimming over with enthusiasm for Saturday morning hikes and moonlight\ntoboggan slides.\u201d . . . \u201cEnthusiastic, peppy and eager as she is, she cannot imagine\nwhat Seton Hill does without the Paci\ufb01c Ocean. \u2018Don\u2019t you really miss surf riding?\u2019\nwas her closing remark to the reporter for Setonian.\u201d\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMAYER - 3\n\nMayer\u2019s next position was at Xavier University in New Orleans (now Xavier\nUniversity of Louisiana), the only Catholic institution among the historically black\ncolleges and universities. Material from the Xavier archives includes correspondence\nrelated to her position there. In an inquiry of January 1939 from Sedalia, Missouri,\nto Xavier University, Mayer wrote that she had read with interest their monthly\nbulletin about the education of \u201ccolored young people.\u201d She noted that her sister\nMary Helen had written to them before but that at the time she, Joanna, \u201cwas\nnot well enough to teach large classes.\u201d She reported that she was stronger and\n\u201cwould be willing to teach nine or ten hours of Mathematics for the equivalent\nof board and room and a little spending money, providing by doing so I would\nbe of assistance to your Xavier University. I do not have an appointment for this\nsemester, not that I could not make myself useful at home, but it seems a little\nsel\ufb01sh to stay at home when I could be of some use to a Catholic college.\u201d She\nwrote that she had taught in well-known Catholic colleges for eight years. She also\nindicated that she had taught chemistry and education but preferred mathematics\nand appended a list of courses she had taught. The list includes most courses in\nthe standard undergraduate curriculum plus modern geometry, higher plane curves,\nadvanced calculus, theory of equations, history of mathematics, modern algebraic\ntheory, projective geometry, and invariants.\n\nIn August 1939 Mayer received a letter from the president of Xavier University\nindicating that their mathematics teacher had asked to be released and inviting\nher to come under the terms she had suggested in her earlier letter. Thus, Mayer\nbegan teaching at Xavier in autumn 1939 at about $85 per month, which was to\ninclude room and board, \u201cnot as salary, . . . but as the compensation which would\nbe agreeable to [her].\u201d During the summer of 1940 she was at home in Sedalia,\nMissouri. A letter of August 1 inquired whether her services would be wanted at\nXavier in the fall.\n\nMayer did return to Xavier for the 1940\u201341 academic year, but she wrote in\nFebruary 1941, indicating that her services would not be available after June. She\nreturned to Sedalia, where her father was su\ufb00ering from cancer. Mayer expressed\nthe hope that they could get back to Oakland, California, by September but was\ndoubtful that her father\u2019s health would be good enough for travel. She remained in\nSedalia, where he died late in December. Mayer indicated that her mother sold the\neighty-acre farm in Missouri, and she and her mother moved to San Jose.\n\nIn a letter to Xaxier in the summer of 1942 she mentioned that she hoped to\nteach at Stanford, but they did not know for certain whether they would need her.\nShe also noted that her mother had grandchildren in the San Francisco Bay area. In\nAugust 1942 Mayer wrote to Xavier that she had an o\ufb00er of a position at San Jose\nState College but needed a junior college credential; in order to make application\nfor that credential she needed a letter verifying her teaching experience. This she\nreceived from Xavier, but it appears that she did not teach anywhere during the\nyear 1942\u201343. Mayer wrote in a letter to the Marquette graduate school dean in\n1956 that she left teaching in 1942 and had supported herself since by buying and\nselling stocks. It is not clear from Mayer\u2019s letters written in the 1980s how she spent\nthe rest of her life, although listings in the AMS and city directories indicate that\nafter she returned to California following her father\u2019s death, she spent most of the\nrest of the 1940s in Santa Clara, California, working at least some of the time as a\nstenographer.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMAYER - 4\n\nMayer wrote in 1985 that during World War II she served in Washington, D.C.,\nand that in 1950 she did secretarial work for the Guided Missiles Committee, De-\npartment of Defense, Pentagon, Washington, D.C. She also wrote that she worked\nfor over thirteen years in military pay, etc. at the military personnel records center\nin St. Louis. We have not been able to con\ufb01rm this information.\n\nAt various times during her life, Mayer was unable to work because of illness.\nShe was a devout Roman Catholic who lived much of the latter part of her life in\nSan Jose, California. She died at the San Jose Medical Center of cardiac arrest in\n1991, two days after having had a mastectomy and a week before her eighty-seventh\nbirthday.

February 17, 1904\u2013September 11, 1981.\nGoucher College (BA 1924), Johns Hopkins University (MA 1927, PhD 1929).\n\nMildred Caroline Somerset Waters was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the second\nof two daughters of Caroline F. (b. 1870) and Robert F. Waters (b. 1867) from\nMaryland. Her parents were married in about 1896, and her older sister, Ruth, was\nborn in 1898. Robert Waters was proprietor of a feed store; in 1920 her sister was\na kindergarten teacher.\n\nMildred Waters had her early education in public and private schools in Balti-\nmore before doing her undergraduate work at nearby Goucher College. After her\ngraduation in 1924, she was a graduate student in chemistry at the Johns Hopkins\nUniversity in Baltimore for the year 1924\u201325. She transferred to the mathematics\ndepartment in the fall of 1925, continued her work in residence at Johns Hopkins\nthe next two years, and received her master\u2019s degree in 1927. Her master\u2019s essay,\ndirected by Frank Morley, was the beginning of the work in inversive geometry that\nshe was to continue for her PhD dissertation.\n\nIn the fall of 1927, Mildred Waters married Charles Earle Dean (1898\u20131993), who\nhad received his PhD in physics that year from Johns Hopkins. He was born in South\nCarolina and had earned an AB from Harvard in 1921 and an MA from Columbia\nin 1923. Since his work as a technical writer with AT&T required a move to New\nYork, Mildred Dean discontinued her course work at Johns Hopkins. She continued\nher graduate work by taking a full-time program at Columbia University from the\nsummer of 1927 through the spring of 1928. She also continued to work on her\ndissertation, mainly on her own, with occasional visits to Baltimore for discussions\nwith Morley. She took her oral examination at Johns Hopkins in January 1929\nand received her doctorate in February with subordinate subjects chemistry and\ngeological physics.\n\nFrom 1929 until 1963, Charles E. Dean worked as a technical writer and editor for\nthe Hazeltine Corporation in Little Neck, Queens, New York. During that period,\nthe Deans raised a family, and Mildred Dean had various teaching positions in\nthe New York area. A son, Robert Waters, was born in 1929, and a daughter,\nMargaret Lewis, was born in 1932. Mildred Dean taught part time at Brooklyn\nCollege 1931\u201333, at Queens College 1942\u201347, and at Adelphi College 1947\u201348. She\nwas a temporary instructor at Hunter College, taught at Hofstra, and in 1971\nreported that she had retired from her last position at Queens.\n\nIn 1963 the Deans moved to the Washington, D.C., area, where Mildred Dean\nparticipated in the Forum for Professionals and Executives, a study group, and\nvolunteered for Travellers Aid in Union Station and in the accounting o\ufb03ce for the\nAmerican Cancer Society.\n\nHaving su\ufb00ered from heart and lung ailments for some time, Mildred Waters\nDean died at her home in Takoma Park, Maryland, at seventy-seven in 1981.

April 18, 1877\u2013September 5, 1962.\nWest Virginia University (BA 1915, MA 1917), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1920).\n\nBird Margaret Turner was the second child and \ufb01rst of four daughters of Mary Jane\n(Douglas) (1847\u20131917) and John Marion Turner (1838\u20131910). Her parents were natives of\nVirginia (West Virginia after statehood in 1863) and married in 1873. Her father was a\nfarmer in the Moundsville area in the northwest panhandle of West Virginia from before\nher birth in Moundsville until his retirement. Her brother, Will D., was two years older\nthan she, and her three sisters were Lulu (1879\u20131953), Carrie (b. 1881), and Dess (1887\u2013\n1949).\n\nBird Turner graduated from the Moundsville high school in 1893 and taught in the\nMoundsville area for most of the next two decades. She taught at Wood Hill school, a\ncounty grade school, 1895\u201396, and in Moundsville 1896\u20131900, where she taught fourth,\nseventh, and eighth grades. She taught mathematics in the Moundsville high school 1900\u2013\n1913. Starting in 1900 she took summer courses toward her undergraduate degree: at\nWest Virginia University in 1900, at Harvard University in 1907, at Bethany College in\nWest Virginia in 1909 (spring and summer), and again at West Virginia University in the\nsummers 1910, 1912\u201314. She was a student assistant at West Virginia University 1913\u201315\nand received her BA there in 1915, at age thirty-eight, with majors in mathematics and\nphysics. She was a member of the social sorority Kappa Kappa Gamma and the English\nclub and won the Chi Omega prize in economics. Turner was an instructor in the summer\nschool at West Virginia University in 1915, returned to Moundsville as principal of the\nhigh school for the year 1915\u201316, and was instructor in the summer school at West Virginia\nagain in the summer of 1916.\n\nTurner began her graduate work as a scholar in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College\nin the academic year 1916\u201317. During that \ufb01rst year she took a \u201cseminary\u201d in di\ufb00erential\ngeometry, one in formal algebra, one in education, and the journal club in mathematics.\nShe was granted the (honorary) President M. Carey Thomas European fellowship for her\n\ufb01rst year\u2019s work. She received her master\u2019s degree from West Virginia University in 1917\nand was assistant director of the Phebe Anna Thorne Model School of Bryn Mawr College\n1917\u201318; she lists the Model School as her a\ufb03liation for the January 1920 MAA meeting\nin New York City. Turner was a reader in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College during\n1918\u201319, and, as a resident fellow during 1919\u201320, she \ufb01nished her dissertation under\nthe direction of Charlotte A. Scott. While at Bryn Mawr, she had studied under Scott,\nOlive C. Hazlett, Anna Johnson Pell (Wheeler), and Matilde Castro. Turner was Scott\u2019s\nsixth, and next-to-last, PhD student and was forty-three when she received her doctorate.\nBetween the ages of forty-\ufb01ve and \ufb01fty-two she published three articles in the American\nJournal of Mathematics and two in the Annals of Mathematics.\n\nTurner was an instructor at the University of Illinois for three years after she received\nher PhD in 1920. In 1923 she returned to West Virginia University, and in November\nof the following year she gave a talk at the organizational meeting of the West Virginia\nAcademy of Science. She was assistant professor 1923\u201325, associate professor 1925\u201331, and\nprofessor 1931\u201347. In 1947, at age seventy, she retired as professor emeritus. A colleague\nat West Virginia University was Margaret Buchanan Cole, who had also received a BA\nfrom West Virginia and who overlapped with Turner in her studies at Bryn Mawr before\nreceiving her PhD in 1922.\n\nFour years after her retirement, Turner returned to Moundsville, where she was a\nmember of the Moundsville Presbyterian Church and the Moundsville Women\u2019s Club. She\nwas a Republican. Bird Turner died in her home in Moundsville, West Virginia, at age\neighty-\ufb01ve in 1962. She was survived by nieces and nephews and was buried in Mt.

December 6, 1878\u2013July 13, 1956.\nColumbian University (BA 1899), University of Pennsylvania (MA 1900, PhD\n1905).\n\nAlice Madeleine (Elsie) McKelden was born in Washington, D.C., the seventh of\nnine children of Alice Maria (McIntosh) (1843\u20131932) and William Blagrove McK-\nelden (1842\u20131905), both natives of the District of Columbia, who married in October\n1864. Her father worked for the US Treasury Department and was cashier of the\ntreasury at the time of his death. Her mother was a teacher in the public schools\nof Washington before her marriage. There were seven daughters and two sons in\nthe family. They were Margaret Vernon Blagrove (1865\u20131942), a registered nurse;\nClara Alexander (April 1867\u2013July 1867); Edith Parthenia (1869\u20131941); Louise Beat-\nrice (1872\u20131947); Frederick Eastman (January 2, 1875\u2013February 26, 1875); Mary\n(Marie) Christie (1876\u20131942); Alice Madeleine; William Blagrove Jr. (1881\u20131938);\nand Irma Eldridge (1885\u20131966).\n\nAlice McKelden graduated from Central High School in Washington, D.C., in\n1895. She then received by competitive examination a four-year scholarship to\nColumbian (now George Washington) University. She received medals in both math-\nematics and Greek and graduated from Columbian in 1899. She entered the Uni-\nversity of Pennsylvania as a university scholar in mathematics in October 1899.\nDuring 1899\u20131900 she took seven courses in mathematics, six in Greek, and one in\nclassical philology, and passed written examinations in Greek, in modern analytical\ngeometry, and in complex variables before receiving her master\u2019s degree in 1900.\nMcKelden studied at Harvard in the summer session 1901 and at Johns Hopkins in\n1901\u201302, although it is not clear what courses she may have attended. In 1902\u201303\nand 1903\u201304 McKelden was a Moore fellow and a Bennett fellow, respectively, at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania. She \ufb01nished her work for the PhD with a dissertation\nin the theory of \ufb01nite groups in 1905.\n\nAfter receiving her doctorate, McKelden taught in at least one preparatory school\nand at the Philadelphia High School for Girls. On June 12, 1907, Alice McKelden\nmarried Chester Edward Dimick. Dimick was born in New Hampshire in 1880,\nreceived a BA in 1901 from Harvard and an MA in 1907 from the University of\nPennsylvania. He taught in the Louisville School for Boys 1901\u201303 and at the Uni-\nversity of Pennsylvania 1903\u201306. In 1906 Chester Dimick became an instructor of\nmathematics on the USS Chase with the US Revenue Cutter Service, later the US\nCoast Guard. After the wedding, the Dimicks sailed for Europe, where they trav-\neled during the summer. From the time of their marriage, Chester E. Dimick was a\nmember of the mathematics department faculty at what later became the United\nStates Coast Guard Academy. He joined the faculty there as a civilian instructor,\nand they lived in Baltimore when the academy was in Arundel Cove, Maryland. In\n1910 the academy moved to New London, Connecticut, and they lived in the New\nLondon area for the next thirty-\ufb01ve years. Chester Dimick was later commissioned\na commander and was a captain at the time of his retirement; he served as professor\nand dean. A mathematics award in his name was established by Alice M. Dimick\nin 1944, and Dimick Hall on the campus of the academy is named for him. There\nwere no children of the marriage.\n\nAlice Dimick inherited an interest in genealogy from her mother who collected in-\nformation on the McKelden and McIntosh families.

Frink, the husband of her youngest\nsister (McKelden and Dimick, i).\n\nAlice M. Dimick occasionally served as a substitute teacher in the high school in\nNew London and as a private tutor, but was mainly involved with various social,\nchurch, and civic volunteer activities. She belonged to the social sorority Kappa\nKappa Gamma and was a member of its subdivision of alumnae whose husbands\nwere in the US military service. She belonged to the Daughters of the American\nRevolution, the International Association of University Women, and was involved\nwith the YWCA. She was president of the New London Unit of the League of Coast\nGuard Women, vice chairman of the New London Unit of the Coast Guard League,\nand president of the New London Tuesday Book Club.\n\nIn addition to her local activities, Dimick served on the national level with the\nGirls\u2019 Friendly Society, an international religious, educational, service, and creative\narts group, a\ufb03liated with the Episcopal Church, for girls and young women. She\nserved as national secretary in the late 1930s, on the national board of directors,\nand as national president; she contributed articles on the society to the society\u2019s\nRecord. The Dimicks vacationed in Hawaii in summer 1939.\n\nAfter Chester Dimick\u2019s retirement as head of the mathematics department at\nthe US Coast Guard Academy in 1945, the Dimicks moved to Tryon, North Car-\nolina.

March 13, 1896\u2013May 5, 1989.\nUniversity of Arkansas (BA 1915), University of Missouri (MA 1916), Univer-\nsity of Chicago (PhD 1924).\n\nJewell Constance Hughes was the the \ufb01fth of six children of Cora A. (Stanley) (b.\n1867), originally from Missouri, and James R. Hughes (b. 1862), a native of Indiana.\nShe was born in Fayetteville, Arkansas, where her father was a merchant in 1900,\nan operator of a sawmill in 1910, and later a timberman and sawmill operator. The\nother children were Leslie Claire (1887\u20131971), Verda (1889\u20131985), Harry (b. 1892),\nAnna (1894\u20131975), and Donald (b. 1899).\n\nJewell Hughes attended public elementary school 1901\u201308 in Fayetteville and\nFayetteville High School 1908\u201311. She entered the University of Arkansas in 1911\nat age \ufb01fteen, became a member of Chi Omega social sorority, and graduated in\n1915. She immediately received a scholarship at the University of Missouri, where\nshe studied mathematics with E. R. Hedrick, O. D. Kellogg, and Louis Ingold in\n1915\u201316 and received her master\u2019s degree in 1916.\n\nHughes taught for two years at the Columbia, Missouri, high school before re-\nturning to the University of Arkansas in 1918 as instructor of mathematics. She\nremained at Arkansas until 1930: as instructor 1918\u201324, assistant professor 1924\u2013\n27, and associate professor 1927\u201330. She was granted a leave of absence for the\nacademic year 1923\u201324 for study at the University of Chicago. Hughes studied\nunder E. H. Moore, G. A. Bliss, L. E. Dickson, F. R. Moulton, and Mayme I. Logs-\ndon at Chicago, \ufb01rst in the summer quarters 1920\u201323 and then in the following\nfour quarters; she was a teaching fellow 1923\u201324. She wrote her dissertation in the\ncalculus of variations before receiving her PhD magna cum laude in August 1924.\nWhile continuing to teach at the University of Arkansas, Hughes did further\nstudy at the University of California in summer 1925 and at the University of\nChicago summer 1927. She traveled in Europe in the summer of 1928. Later post-\ndoctoral study included a course at Columbia University during 1934 and work at\nthe University of Chicago in summer 1938.\n\nIn 1930 Hughes joined the faculty at Hunter College as assistant professor. She\nwas assured at the time of the o\ufb00er that she would be promoted to associate pro-\nfessor, her rank at the University of Arkansas, in a short time. An attitude she\nexpressed at a dinner talk at the December 1927 mathematics meetings may par-\ntially explain why she left Arkansas. \u201cMiss Jewell Hughes told of the opportunities\nfor women in the teaching of mathematics in the United States, a\ufb03rming and sub-\nstantiating the statement that women have an opportunity equal with that of men\nin college and university positions unless it be in the higher university positions\u201d\n(Amer. Math. Monthly 35 (1928): 103). Hughes remained at Hunter the rest of her\ncareer: as assistant professor 1930\u201339, as associate professor 1939\u201351, as professor\n1951\u201366, and as professor emeritus after her retirement at age seventy.\n\nOn June 24, 1935, Jewell Hughes and Joseph Hobart Bushey, a colleague at\nHunter College, were married at the home of her brother, Leslie C. Hughes, in\nElizabeth, New Jersey. J. Hobart Bushey (December 19, 1903\u2013November 25, 1976),\noriginally from Baltimore, had received his BS from the Johns Hopkins University\nin 1924 and his MA and PhD in mathematics from the University of Michigan in\n1928 and 1930, respectively. He had also joined the mathematics department at\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBUSHEY - 2\n\nHunter College as an assistant professor in 1930. He was promoted to associate\nprofessor in 1936 and to professor in 1953. He retired at age seventy.\n\nIn 1940 Jewell H. Bushey was elected chairman of the mathematics department\nat Hunter replacing Lao G. Simons who retired in June of that year. In addition\nto her teaching and administrative work, Bushey was extremely active in college\nservice and in organizations at the college. She was a member of college committees\nconcerned with the curriculum, with student-faculty relations, with faculty-board\nrelations, and with adult education, among others. During 1943\u201350 she was chair-\nman of the executive committee of the faculty. For the Hunter chapter of AAUP,\nshe was treasurer part of 1936\u201337, vice president 1937\u201338, and president 1938\u201340.\nShe was also president for several years of the Hunter Phi Beta Kappa chapter and\nwas director at times of the local Pi Mu Epsilon chapter. During the summer of\n1959 she directed an NSF institute for junior and senior high school teachers.\n\nJewell Hughes Bushey was active in a number of professional organizations at the\nnational level, as well. As early as December 1925, when she was an assistant pro-\nfessor at the University of Arkansas, she gave the \ufb01rst of her many dinner speeches\nat joint meetings of the AMS and MAA. This \ufb01rst speech was a recollection of her\nrecent time as a graduate student at the University of Chicago. A December 1929\nspeech was described as \u201creplete with wit\u201d (Amer. Math. Monthly 37 (1930): 107),\nwhile a 1951 speech was \u201cabout the past and present status of women mathemati-\ncians, stating certain theorems on this subject\u201d (Amer. Math. Monthly 59 (1952):\n208). The last dinner speech she made that was described in the Monthly was forty\nyears after the \ufb01rst; this speech was made on behalf of her fellow charter members\nof the MAA at the \ufb01ftieth anniversary meeting in August 1965. She also spoke at\nthe 1937 luncheon organized by Helen B. Owens that honored women pioneers in\nmathematical research in America.\n\nBetween her \ufb01rst and last speeches, Bushey served the MAA in various ways:\nshe was on several program committees for national meetings, was chairman of\nthe Metropolitan New York Section 1944\u201345, was national second vice president\n1951\u201352, was governor from the Metropolitan New York Section 1957\u201360, and was\non the committee on secondary school lecturers 1961\u201363. She was also an advocate\nfor faculty and in 1940 was appointed to an AAUP committee to investigate the\ndismissal of \ufb01ve faculty members from Adelphi University. She was a member of\nthe AAUP national council 1942\u201344 and of its executive committee 1942\u201343. She\nwas a member of a joint committee of AAUP and the Association of American\nColleges on tenure and retirement in 1943. She served as a national vice president\nof the AAUP 1944\u201346, was a member of the committee on the economic status of\nthe profession 1948, was chairman of the nominating committee for national o\ufb03cers\nfor 1948\u201350, and was on the board of the Bulletin of the AAUP in 1951.\n\nIn June 1949 Jewell Bushey was awarded an honorary LLD degree from the\nUniversity of Arkansas, the second woman to receive that degree from Arkansas. The\nJewell Hughes Bushey scholarship for pro\ufb01ciency in mathematics was established\nby the Hunter College Pi Mu Epsilon chapter the year she retired.\n\nAfter J. Hobart Bushey retired from Hunter in 1972, the Busheys moved back\nto Fayetteville, Arkansas. He died four years later, shortly before his seventy-third\nbirthday.

September 13, 1882\u2013June 30, 1967.\nUniversity of Missouri (BA 1908, BS 1908, MA 1909, PhD 1915).\n\nEula Adeline Weeks was born near Louisville, Georgia, the third of \ufb01ve children\nof Luella Vienna (Tarver) (1860\u20131935) and Caleb Garvin Weeks (1850\u20131914). Her\nparents, natives of Georgia, married in about 1878. Her older brothers, William\nBrinson (1879\u20131914) and Julian Charles (1880\u20131951), were born in Georgia; her\nyounger sisters, Clara Belle (1887\u20131914) and Alice Elizabeth (1900\u20131991), were\nborn in Missouri. Her father was successively a bookkeeper, a bank clerk, and later\na county court clerk.\n\nIn 1900 and 1910 her family lived in Bates County, Missouri, near the Kansas\nborder. Weeks was a teacher in the high school in Rich Hill, Missouri, from 1901 to\n1907. In 1908, at age twenty-\ufb01ve, she received both a BA and a BS in education,\nand was valedictorian of the class of 1908 in the College of Arts and Science at the\nUniversity of Missouri. The next year she was a university fellow in mathematics\nand in 1909 received a master\u2019s degree from Missouri.\n\nEula Weeks then went to Bryn Mawr College, where she was a fellow in mathe-\nmatics 1909\u201310 and a fellow by courtesy 1910\u201311. Her occupation is listed as teacher\nin a preparatory school in the 1910 census, as well. The journal club at Bryn Mawr\ndid not hold meetings 1909\u201310, but her presentations are recorded for 1910\u201311,\nwhen she spoke on the solution of numerical equations, and for 1911\u201312, when she\npresented papers on the group of homographic substitutions and on general analytic\nmethods of solutions of transcendental equations.\n\nAfter three years at Bryn Mawr, Weeks returned to Missouri, where she held a\nuniversity fellowship 1914\u201315 and received her PhD in 1915. She was one of two\nstudents whose work was directed by E. R. Hedrick at the University of Missouri.\nIn addition to his many research, editorial, and administrative activities, Hedrick\nbecame the \ufb01rst president of the MAA in 1916 and was especially involved with\nreforms in secondary mathematics teaching. Eula Weeks was a charter member of\nthe MAA.\n\nIn 1916 Eula A. Weeks was a teacher at Grover Cleveland High School in St.\nLouis. By 1919 she had been appointed to the National Committee on Mathematical\nRequirements as one of three secondary school representatives. The committee was\n\ufb01rst appointed in 1916 by Hedrick as president of the MAA and was chaired by J. W.\nYoung of Dartmouth; Weeks served on a subcommittee to report on elective courses\nin secondary schools. A preliminary report of the committee, issued as Secondary\nSchool Circular No. 5 by the US Bureau of Education, appeared in 1920. The \ufb01nal\nreport of the committee was published by the MAA in 1923, and parts of it were\nreprinted by Houghton Mi\ufb04in in 1927. Weeks gave several talks about the reports\nat meetings of the MAA. During this period Weeks continued teaching at Cleveland\nHigh School and was active in organizations for mathematics teachers. In 1920 she\nwas elected secretary of the mathematics section of the Missouri Society of Science\nand Mathematics Teachers, and she served as vice president of the NCTM 1922\u201323\nand on the NCTM board of directors 1923\u201326.\n\nEula Weeks married Harry Lane King (1885\u20131966) on June 15, 1924, in St. Louis.\nHarry King was born in Topeka, Kansas, and was a high school teacher in St. Louis.\nAt least in the mid-1940s he was a teacher in the industrial arts department at\nGrover Cleveland High School.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nKING - 2\n\nEula Weeks King stopped teaching after she married, although she maintained\nher membership in the MAA until about 1940. The Kings had two children, Harry\nL. King Jr., born in 1925, and Mary Adeline, born in 1927. Their son became a\ncivil engineer and died in 1973.\n\nAfter her husband\u2019s death in 1966, King maintained the same residence in St.\nLouis she had had since at least 1930. She went to her son\u2019s home in Inglewood,\nCalifornia, about a month before her death there of a myocardial infarction at age\neighty-four in June 1967.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, NCTM.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1909 [Weeks, E.

      "text": "DARKOW, Marguerite D. November 12, 1893\u2013December 9, 1992.\nBryn Mawr College (BA 1915), University of Chicago (MA 1923, PhD 1924).\n\nMarguerite Daisy Darkow was the second of three daughters of Flora (Singer)\n(1867\u20131942) and Martin Darkow (1856\u20131928). Her mother, born in Vienna, studied\nin private schools there; she learned German, French, English, a little Italian, and\nstudied piano from a well-known teacher there. Martin Darkow was born in Riga,\nthen in Russia. He studied violin as a boy and learned piano and organ. He attended\ncollege in Vienna. Flora Singer and Martin Darkow were married in 1888, and their\n\ufb01rst daughter, Angela Charlotte (1889\u20131943), was born in Vienna. They immigrated\nto the United States in about 1891, and Marguerite was born in Philadelphia two\nyears later. The youngest daughter, Felice Evelyn (1898\u20131989), was also born in\nPhiladelphia. Martin Darkow\u2019s occupation was listed as doctor in 1900, newspaper\neditor in 1910, and music teacher in 1920. Both Flora and Martin Darkow taught\npiano, but for the most part, he earned his living as a music and theatre critic for\na German language newspaper.\n\nIn the mid-1910s, Martin Darkow was managing editor of a socialist German-\nlanguage newspaper, the Philadelphia Tageblatt, that reported the war news from\na German perspective. In September 1917 he, along with others connected with the\nnewspaper, was indicted and tried for treason and for violation of the Espionage\nAct for making false statements to help the enemy. These charges were based on\narticles and editorials that appeared after the United States had declared war on\nGermany in early April 1917. In 1918 Darkow was acquitted on the treason charge\nbut was convicted on the other charges. He received a \ufb01ve-year sentence that he\nappealed. Even though the Supreme Court upheld the conviction in March 1920,\nDarkow was never imprisoned and was pardoned by President Woodrow Wilson in\nJune that year.\n\nAll three daughters earned higher degrees. Angela Darkow earned a BA in 1911,\nan MA in 1912, and a PhD in Greek literature in 1914 from Bryn Mawr. She\ntaught Greek and Latin for several years in private high schools, later worked as\nan actuary, made and sold jam and \ufb01ne embroideries during the Depression, was\na bookkeeper, worked temporarily for the US Bureau of Labor Statistics, and died\nof cancer after a long illness. Felice E. Darkow received her BA in 1920 from the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania and her LLB from the law school there. She had a variety\nof positions; the last two decades of her career she was with the US Department\nof Labor, \ufb01rst in Philadelphia and then in Washington, D.C. She was given the\nDistinguished Service Award upon her retirement.\n\nMarguerite Darkow attended the E. Spencer Miller School in Philadelphia 1899\u2013\n1907 and the Philadelphia High School for Girls 1907\u201311 before entering Bryn Mawr\nCollege in 1911. During her four years at Bryn Mawr she held several scholarships.\nShe was First Bryn Mawr Matriculation Scholar for Pennsylvania and the Southern\nStates 1911\u201312, Simon Muir scholar 1911\u201315, James E. Rhoads junior scholar 1913\u2013\n14, and Maria L. Eastman Brooke Hall memorial scholar 1914\u201315. She graduated in\nmathematics and physics in 1915 and led the list of honor students. As the student\nwith the highest average, Darkow was awarded a Bryn Mawr European fellowship\nfor 1915\u201316; a Philadelphia newspaper reported that she had attained the highest\naverage of any Bryn Mawr student since 1900. Her mother\u2019s cousin, the philosopher\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nDARKOW - 2\n\nEdmund Husserl, was then at G\u00a8ottingen and encouraged her to come there to study,\nbut she delayed using the fellowship because of the war in Europe.\n\nIn 1915\u201316 Darkow taught mathematics and science at Tudor Hall, a private\nschool for girls in Indianapolis. During the summer of 1916 she studied at the\nUniversity of Pennsylvania before entering the Johns Hopkins University that fall.\nShe was a graduate student and fellowship holder in physics and mathematics 1916\u2013\n17, during which she had courses in higher geometry, theory of functions, and\ntheory of mechanics of physical optics. In the summer of 1917, she did statistical\nwork for the children\u2019s bureau of the US Department of Labor. In 1917\u201318 she\nreturned to teaching mathematics and science, this time at Rogers Hall in Lowell,\nMassachusetts, and the following year, 1918\u201319, she did astronomical research at\nthe Leander McCormick Observatory at the University of Virginia. During several\nsummers she worked as both a private tutor and as a tutor for fall college entrance\nexams at tutoring camps in New England. From 1917, and continuing into the\n1920s, Darkow\u2019s father was often mentioned in the news making it di\ufb03cult for her\nto pursue a normal career. On April 20, 1917, a few weeks after the United States\nentered the war against Germany, M. Carey Thomas, president of Bryn Mawr,\nwrote to Charlotte Scott, head of the mathematics department:\n\nI should not be willing to nominate Miss Darkow for any position in\nBryn Mawr College. . . . I am particularly anxious that the question\nshould not be brought up as I think that it might hurt her future\ncareer as a teacher. I should also not be willing for her to correct\nexamination papers. I do not wish to bring her into connection\nin any way with Bryn Mawr College. (M. Carey Thomas Papers,\nmicro\ufb01lm reel 137, LXII, 138)\n\nAlthough Thomas does not explain the reasons behind her attitude toward Darkow,\nthe proximity of Bryn Mawr to Philadelphia would have made it likely that Thomas\nwas already aware of the writing that later led to Martin Darkow\u2019s indictment\nfor treason. Furthermore, other of Thomas\u2019s o\ufb03cial papers of the time have been\ndescribed as including \u201cher e\ufb00orts to assure that German propaganda be banned\nfrom the [Bryn Mawr] campus\u201d (M. Carey Thomas Papers Guide and Micro\ufb01lm\nEdition, Reel 137: M. Carey Thomas O\ufb03cial Papers; Letterbook no. 62. February\n17, 1917 - January 3, 1918).\n\nIn 1920 Darkow was living in her parents\u2019 home in Philadelphia. She began\nworking in the actuarial department of the Provident Life Insurance Company in\nPhiladelphia in 1919 or 1920 and passed section A, part I, of the Actuarial Society of\nAmerica examinations in May 1920. She passed part II of the associate examination\nin May 1921 and part III in May 1922.\n\nDarkow left her position at Provident in 1922 to enter graduate school at the\nUniversity of Chicago with a fellowship. She earned her master\u2019s degree in 1923\nand continued another year at Chicago with a fellowship. She received her PhD\nin August 1924 with a dissertation written under the direction of L. E. Dickson.\nThe results in her dissertation and in her 1927 paper in the Annals of Mathematics\nwere cited in papers through at least 1940. In 1924\u201325, she traveled in Europe and\n\ufb01nally used the European fellowship awarded by Bryn Mawr in 1915 to study at\nthe Sorbonne in Paris. During this trip she visited Edmund Husserl, who was then\nat Freiberg and who again urged her to go to G\u00a8ottingen.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nDARKOW - 3\n\nDarkow was appointed assistant professor at Indiana University in Bloomington\nin 1925, and her appointment was terminated after two years. Correspondence\nfrom the time reveals issues or misunderstandings. The university president wrote\nthat her appointment was originally a one-year appointment to replace a faculty\nmember on leave. Darkow responded that nothing in the original appointment letter\nindicated that that was the case. She also noted that L. E. Dickson, her advisor at\nChicago, recommended at the time that she give up the National Research Council\nfellowship to which she had been appointed and take the Indiana position instead,\nand that he would not have done so for a one-year position. There is a further\nquestion of whether a report to the president that she was a reader of the American\nMercury magazine and an admirer of H. L. Mencken contributed to the dismissal.\nDarkow clearly felt that it had (President\u2019s \ufb01les, Indiana University Archives). In\nany case, the following year, 1927\u201328, she was an instructor at Pennsylvania State\nCollege.\n\nIn the fall of 1928 Darkow began her career at Hunter College in New York,\nwhere she was instructor 1928\u201330, assistant professor 1928\u201342, associate professor\n1942\u201356, professor 1956\u201359, and professor emeritus after her retirement in 1959.\nShe continued her study of mathematics at the University of Chicago in summer\n1938 and studied statistics at the University of Michigan the following two sum-\nmers. In June 1940 Darkow indicated in a letter to Helen Owens that she had \u201ca\nshort paper, \u2018Generalized Center-circles,\u2019 in search of a publisher\u201d (Owens Papers).\nIn that same letter, she also commented on women in mathematics noting that\nwomen spend time on \u201cminor domestic duties that certainly hamper their ener-\ngies.\u201d Nonetheless, she indicated that \u201cif we exclude the \ufb01rst-rate Mathematicians,\nI believe we will \ufb01nd many women who can compete with men in the second rank, as\nteachers, statisticians, etc.\u201d The following year Darkow and a colleague at Hunter,\nMary K. Landers, wrote a preliminary edition of a textbook they called Elementary\nMathematics. Darkow sometimes served as faculty advisor of the Hunter College\nmathematics club and as director of the Hunter chapter of Pi Mu Epsilon.\n\nDarkow was interested in bird watching, travel, \ufb02owers, photography, reading,\nand corresponding with friends. She knew Latin and Greek, read both German and\nFrench with ease, and taught herself Spanish and a little Italian after her retirement.\nShe traveled frequently. She regularly contributed to charities and was a member\nof the American Civil Liberties Union and various anti-nuclear organizations. In\n1936 she hosted Edmund Husserl\u2019s son, Gerhart, a law professor, and his son-in-\nlaw, Jakob Rosenberg, an art historian, when they came to the United States to\nescape from Nazi Germany. As established academics, both of these cousins had\njobs waiting for them. In March 1940, a Jewish cousin who was \ufb02eeing Austria\nwithout a job in the United States listed Darkow\u2019s address as her destination on\nthe manifest of alien passengers arriving in the United States.\n\nIn about 1950, Darkow became close friends with Edna Sheinhart (1923\u20131995),\nwho had graduated from Hunter in the 1940s and was a research engineer. After\nDarkow\u2019s retirement they shared an apartment in New York, traveled together, and\nthen shared a home in Berkshire County, Massachusetts. Sheinhart had bought a\nfarm in She\ufb03eld, and the renovated barn became their permanent home in 1972.\nTheir last good trip was to Egypt in 1979. In about 1982 Darkow was diagnosed\nwith Alzheimer\u2019s disease. She remained in her home and was cared for by Sheinhart\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nDARKOW - 4\n\nand a sta\ufb00 of care givers. Marguerite Darkow died in her home in 1992. She was\nninety-nine. Her ashes were buried at the top of the hill on the premises.\n\nA letter from Dorothy Garfein, a friend and executor of her estate, informing\nBryn Mawr of Darkow\u2019s death, indicated that \u201cas a tribute to her lifelong concern\nfor wildlife and the environment a 215 acre tract of farmland and woods was donated\nin Marguerite\u2019s name to the Massachusetts Audubon Society.\u201d This gift formed the\nbasis of a wildlife sanctuary in She\ufb03eld, Massachusetts. It was \ufb01rst called the Mount\nEverett Wildlife Sanctuary but was opened to the public in 2007 as the Lime Kiln\nFarm Wildlife Sanctuary.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, IMS, Sigma Xi, Pi Mu Epsilon.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1923 A Riemann surface for the function z = w \u2212 e sin w, (0 \u2264 e \u2264 1).

January 17, 1903\u2013March 6, 1995.\nGeorgia State College for Women (BS 1926), Cornell University (MS 1930,\nPhD 1939).\n\nSara Louise Nelson was born in Oglethorpe, Georgia, the daughter of Mattie (Trussell)\n(1872\u20131910) and John Pendleton Nelson (1856\u20131932), both natives of Georgia. It was a\nsecond marriage for her father, who was described as a dry goods merchant in 1900, but\nwho later was a teacher and then county superintendent of schools for about the last\ntwenty years of his life. She had one brother, Robert (b. 1898) and at least two older\nhalf-brothers.\n\nSara Nelson received her elementary and secondary education in the public schools of\nOglethorpe, Georgia. She then attended Georgia State College for Women (now Georgia\nCollege and State University), which had been the two-year Georgia Normal and Industrial\nCollege until shortly before her entrance in the summer of 1922. Nelson continued her\nstudies there during the regular school year and all summers until June 1926, when she\nreceived her bachelor\u2019s degree with a major in mathematics and a minor in chemistry. A\nyear earlier she had received a collegiate normal diploma.\n\nFor three and a half years Nelson taught mathematics, chemistry, and history in two\nhigh schools in Georgia. She attended the summer session at Cornell University in 1929\nand then resumed her studies there in February 1930. She continued in the summer of 1930\nand received her master\u2019s degree in September, having studied mathematics and geology\nand physical geography.\n\nIn fall 1930 Nelson joined the faculty at her alma mater, the Georgia State College\nfor Women, where she was to spend the rest of her career except for leaves for further\ngraduate study. She was an instructor for two years before being promoted to assistant\nprofessor.\n\nNelson again took courses at Cornell during the 1933 summer session and then returned\nfor full-time study in 1937. She had requested and received some \ufb01nancial support from\nGeorgia State College for Women. The president also reassured her of her position when\nshe returned. At Cornell she held a tuition scholarship 1937\u201338 and an Erastus Brooks\nfellowship in 1938\u201339. Although she studied mainly with Virgil Snyder, Snyder retired in\n1938, and Robert J. Walker became the chair of her doctoral committee. She received her\ndoctorate in 1939 with a major in geometry, a \ufb01rst minor in algebra, and a second minor\nin analysis.\n\nWhen Nelson returned to Georgia State College for Women in 1939, she was promoted\nto associate professor; in 1942 she was promoted to full professor and became department\nchair. Nelson was particularly interested in the training of teachers and attended an NSF\nsummer workshop on that subject in 1963. She remained as department chair until her\nretirement in 1968, a year after the school become coeducational and was renamed Georgia\nCollege at Milledgeville. Nelson was also active in the school\u2019s alumni association and\nserved as its president from 1943 until 1947 and again from 1978 until 1980. In 1987 the\nassociation honored her with The Georgia College Alumni Heritage Award.\n\nNelson was a member of the Georgia Academy of Science; Phi Kappa Phi, an honor\nsociety for excellence in scholarship; and Pi Gamma Mu, an honor society in the social\nsciences. The pastor of the First United Methodist Church of Milledgeville, where she\ntaught Sunday School for many years, referred to her as \u201cthe mother of the Wesley Foun-\ndation [Campus Ministry] from its infancy to its maturity\u201d (Funeral meditation by Harold\nLawrence, provided by David J. DeVries).\n\nSara Nelson died in a local Milledgeville hospital at the age of ninety-two in 1995 and\nwas buried in the Oglethorpe Cemetery. She was survived by three nieces.

August 28, 1907\u2013November 19, 1999.\nDuke University (Woman\u2019s College) (BA 1928), Duke University (MA 1930,\nPhD 1933).\n\nMabel Jeanette Gri\ufb03n was the youngest of four children of Naomi Frances\n(Burke) (1874\u20131966) and Charles A. Gri\ufb03n (1871\u20131958). Her parents were both\nborn in Chatham County, in central North Carolina. Her mother was born in\nPittsboro, where she attended the Pittsboro Academy; her father attended county\nschools and became a carpenter and home builder. They were married on Janu-\nary 9, 1895. The two older children, Pearl (1895\u20131975) and George Sidney (1898\u2013\n1981), were born in Pittsboro; Theodore Alton (1904-1964) and Mabel were born\nin Durham, North Carolina. Pearl Gri\ufb03n attended Duke University, and George\nand Theodore attended the city schools in Durham. George became a hosiery mill\nowner, and Theodore was in the insurance business.\n\nMabel Gri\ufb03n was one of the \ufb01rst undergraduates at Duke University\u2019s Woman\u2019s\nCollege, which was founded in 1924 as a coordinate college for women. She received\nher bachelor\u2019s degree magna cum laude in 1928. The next year she had a high-school\nteaching position and then returned to Duke for graduate work in mathematics.\nShe had a graduate scholarship 1929\u201331, a graduate fellowship 1931\u201332, and was\nan assistant at Duke 1929\u201332. She completed the work for her master\u2019s degree in\n1930. She taught in high school 1932\u201333, the year before she received her PhD with\na dissertation written under the direction of J. M. Thomas. Ruth Wyckli\ufb00e Stokes\nhad received her doctorate from Duke two years earlier, the \ufb01rst in mathematics\nfrom Duke. After receiving her doctorate, Mabel Gri\ufb03n taught one more year in\nhigh school before teaching two years, 1934\u201336, as professor at Campbell Junior\nCollege (now Campbell University) in Buies Creek, North Carolina.\n\nOn August 3, 1936, Mabel Gri\ufb03n married L. Boyd Reavis, who was born in\n1907 in Warrenton, North Carolina. L. B. Reavis graduated from Campbell Junior\nCollege in 1930. He received further education from Wake Forest University in\nWinston Salem, North Carolina; Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in\nFort Worth, Texas; and Howard Payne College (now University) in Brownwood,\nTexas, from which he earned a Doctor of Divinity degree. After their marriage,\nthey lived in Fort Worth and then Temple, Texas.\n\nFor the \ufb01rst four years of their marriage, 1936\u201340, Mabel Reavis taught as as-\nsistant professor at Mary Hardin\u2013Baylor College (now University of Mary Hardin\u2013\nBaylor) in nearby Belton, Texas. Mary Hardin\u2013Baylor was established in the mid-\nnineteenth century as the women\u2019s division of Baylor University and remained a\nwomen\u2019s college until 1971. Mabel Reavis later served as a trustee of the college.\n\nIn 1939 L. Boyd Reavis took the \ufb01rst of several positions as pastor in Texas.\nDuring the next ten years he was pastor of the First Baptist Church in Plainview\n1939\u201345 and of the First Baptist Church in Paris 1945\u201349. During this time their\nthree children were born. Raynor Boyd was born in December 1940, graduated\nfrom Baylor University, and became an executive with an aerospace corporation.\nRoma Jean, born in April 1943, earned both a bachelor\u2019s and a master\u2019s degree\nfrom Baylor, and became co-host of the Don Wade and Roma Morning Show on\nWLS radio in Chicago in 1985. Ralph Gri\ufb03n, born in November 1946, graduated\nfrom Texas Christian University and then earned a PhD in education from North\nTexas State University before holding positions in academia.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nREAVIS - 2\n\nIn 1949 the Reavis family moved to High Point, North Carolina, where L. Boyd\nReavis was pastor of the Green Street Baptist Church for the next four years. Mabel\nReavis resumed her career as professor and head of the mathematics department at\nHigh Point College 1950\u201353. In 1953 they returned to Texas, where L. B. Reavis was\npastor of the First Baptist Church in Denton for the next two years. In 1955 they\nmoved to Fort Worth, where they remained for forty years. He became director of\ndevelopment for Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary and held that position\nuntil his retirement in 1973.\n\nIn 1955 Mabel Reavis began an eighteen-year period as a mathematics faculty\nmember at Texas Christian University. She was assistant professor 1955\u201358, as-\nsociate professor 1958\u201373, and retired as professor emeritus in 1973. During \ufb01ve\nsummers in the 1960s she was director of the mathematics section of the NSF\nsummer science institute at Texas Christian. Mabel Reavis wrote in 1981,\n\nTeaching is totally satisfying to me. In addition to my enjoyment\nof subject matter I \ufb01nd the students themselves and their devel-\nopment of potential just as important to me. Counseling outside\nthe classroom has consumed much of my time at T. C. U. The\ndemands of rearing 3 children, being supportive of my husband in\nhis ministry, and University teaching have precluded my pursuance\nof further research in mathematics except for direction of several\nMaster\u2019s theses. (Smithsonian questionnaire)\n\nDuring her years as a student, Reavis became a member of the education honor\nsocieties Delta Kappa Gamma and Kappa Delta Pi, and the physics honor society\nSigma Pi Sigma. Later she served as vice president of the TCU chapter of Phi\nBeta Kappa and served on the TCU faculty senate. She was a member of the TCU\nFaculty Woman\u2019s Club and the Seminary Woman\u2019s Club at Southwestern Seminary.\nShe also belonged to the Ridglea Country Club in Fort Worth.\n\nReavis was a Baptist and included various church-related activities among her\ninterests. She served as an Associational Young People\u2019s leader, edited church bul-\nletins, was a member of various study clubs, lectured for local clubs and societies,\nand engaged in Bible teaching. She listed reading and travel among her interests\nand, in 1981, described her political a\ufb03liation as Independent. In 1991 she and her\nhusband established the L. B. and Mabel Reavis professorship and scholarship pro-\ngram at Campbell University; Reavis scholars are honored for leading their churches\nin growth and evangelism.\n\nL. Boyd Reavis died in their Fort Worth home in March 1995. Mabel Reavis\nremained in Fort Worth until 1998, when she moved to Chicago to be close to her\ndaughter. Mabel Gri\ufb03n Reavis died in her Chicago home in November 1999 at age\nninety-two. She was survived by her three children, seven grandchildren, and three\ngreat-grandchildren. She was buried in Laurel Land Memorial Park in Fort Worth.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, AAUW, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, Pi Mu\nEpsilon.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1930 [Gri\ufb03n, M.

      "text": "HOWE, Anna M. October 24, 1883\u2013August 8, 1976.\nWells College (BA 1908), Cornell University (MA 1911, PhD 1917).\n\nAnna Mayme Howe was born in Jordan, New York, the second of two children\nof Eleanor Caldwell (Reed) (1855\u20131943) and Lewis B. Howe (1852\u20131928), natives\nof New York. At the time of the 1900 census the family lived in Auburn, in upper\nNew York State; her parents had been married twenty-one years; and her father\u2019s\noccupation was listed as city missionary. A 1900 Auburn city directory lists Lewis\nB. Howe as superintendent of the Gospel Knowledge and Mission Union; a 1917\ndirectory of Onondaga County lists him as a farmer in Jordan, New York. Her\nolder brother, Raymond R. (1882\u20131953), graduated from Yale University in 1905.\nAnna Mayme Howe graduated from the high school in Auburn, New York, in\n1902, having taken the Latin-scienti\ufb01c course. When she entered nearby Wells Col-\nlege in 1904, shortly before she turned twenty-one, she was one of \ufb01fty-nine entering\nfreshmen. The tuition was $100 per year, and the board, consisting of \u201cfurnished\nroom, light, heat, and the washing of one dozen plain pieces weekly\u201d was $300\n(Wells College catalogue 1904\u201305). While Howe was at Wells, the mathematics pro-\nfessor was Anna Lavinia Van Benschoten, who received her doctorate from Cornell\nin 1908, having taken a leave of absence from Wells during Howe\u2019s junior year,\n1906\u201307. Howe graduated in 1908, at age twenty-four, and taught mathematics the\nnext two years.\n\nHowe studied at Cornell 1910\u201311 and received her master\u2019s degree in 1911 with a\nmajor in mathematics and a minor in education. She then became head of the math-\nematics department at Fairmont Seminary, a school for girls in Washington, D.C.,\nthat is now closed. She indicated later that she was teaching both high school and\ncollege work while there. She remained at Fairmont until 1915, when she returned\nto Cornell with a graduate scholarship in order to work toward her doctorate. She\nwrote her dissertation with Virgil Snyder in algebraic geometry, had a minor in\nmathematical analysis, and took courses in physics. Her dissertation appeared in\n1919 in the American Journal of Mathematics and was cited a number of times by\na fellow Cornell student, Temple Rice Hollcroft, who was professor at Wells College\n1918\u201354. Howe received her doctorate in September 1917 and returned to Fairmont\nto teach for an additional year.\n\nIt appears that the following year, 1918\u201319, Howe was overseer of technical ship-\nments for W. R. Grace and Company in New York. In the fall of 1919, she became a\nteacher of mathematics at Dana Hall, Wellesley, a girls\u2019 preparatory school founded\nin 1881 to address the needs of early Wellesley College students requiring addi-\ntional preparation. The following May, in response to a letter about an opening,\nHowe wrote to the dean of H. Sophie Newcomb College, Tulane University, in New\nOrleans, about a teaching position in the mathematics department there. Details of\nher subsequent hiring and employment at the college appear in letters cited below\nthat are in the Tulane University Archives. In her letter of May 3, 1920, to Dr.\nPierce Butler, Howe wrote that her \u201cpresent salary began last October with $1400\nplus all living expenses but this was increased for the last four months at the rate of\n$50/month. . . . Miss Cooke, the Principal of Dana Hall requests me to remain here\nbut I much prefer college work in Mathematics.\u201d A letter of recommendation of\nMay 17, 1920, from Gertrude E. Preston, the head of the mathematics department\nat Dana Hall, to Butler notes that Howe \u201chas done excellent work in Dana Hall. . . .\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHOWE - 2\n\nYou will \ufb01nd her an earnest young woman, of scholarly attainments and a winning\npersonality. Her ideals, both as scholar and teacher, are high.\u201d Howe accepted the\no\ufb00er of an instructorship for $1500 with board and lodging in the college residence\n(folder: Howe, Anna M., Tulane University Archives).\n\nHowe was on the faculty at Newcomb until 1930: as instructor 1920\u201321 and as\nassistant professor 1921\u201330. She attended the International Mathematical Congress\nin Toronto in 1924 and afterwards reported on bookstores at various women\u2019s col-\nleges in the East, apparently a task she had been assigned by her college dean before\nNewcomb established its own bookstore. In 1925\u201326, Howe received an extra $300\nstipend to serve as \ufb01nancial secretary in charge of bookkeeping and \ufb01nances for a\nnew Club Dormitory. The \ufb01rst year ended with \ufb01nancial success and satis\ufb01ed stu-\ndents, but Howe was told she must make di\ufb00erent arrangements for 1926\u201327. She\nwas to receive room and board but no extra stipend because there were no extra\nduties. Howe was elected to the graduate school faculty in 1926 and planned to give\na course in projective geometry, \u201cexactly as it has been given by Miss Spencer\u201d\naccording to her dean\u2019s recommendation to the graduate dean. Mary Cass Spencer,\nMS, had been professor at Newcomb since the turn of the century.\n\nIn March 1927, Howe had to return home to New York State because of her\nfather\u2019s illness. In a letter of June 24, 1928, Howe explained to the dean that she and\nher mother would be occupying two rooms and eating \u201cin the cafeteria at faculty\nrates or elsewhere.\u201d In the same letter, Howe requested a raise for the following\nyear. She closed by thanking the dean for \u201ctrying to make next year \ufb01nancially\npossible for mother and me.\u201d\n\nOn May 3, 1930, Howe submitted her resignation to the dean of Newcomb Col-\nlege. A letter of recommendation of February 18, 1931, from Dean Butler to Florence\nLewis at Goucher notes, \u201cI do not hesitate to tell you that the real reason for Miss\nHowe\u2019s leaving Newcomb was only her own dissatisfaction in that she was not con-\nsidered suitable for promotion to the head of the department upon the retirement\nof Miss Spencer. It was felt that she did not have the necessary personal force,\nor the necessary health for such position. Miss Howe, quite naturally, was disap-\npointed, and resigned her position. We should have continued her in the position\nshe had been \ufb01lling satisfactorily.\u201d When Howe left in 1930, she was replaced by\nMarie Weiss.\n\nIn 1930, Howe and her widowed mother moved back to Jordan, New York, and\nHowe sought employment in the area. While her work history at this time is some-\nwhat unclear, it appears that Howe found a position about forty miles away at the\nnew Cazenovia Central School in the early 1930s. She indicated in 1937 that she\nwas head of the department at Cazenovia Central School and that she had been\nsupervisor of mathematics in Cazenovia, New York, since 1930. Elsewhere, she re-\nported that she was head of the department in schools in New York from 1931 to\n1948. In May 1942, the former Cazenovia Seminary closed, and the school became\nCazenovia Junior College. At that time, Howe became professor and head of the\ndepartment at the college (now Cazenovia College). She remained there until 1957.\nHowe was involved in a number of professional and non-professional activities.\nShe became a charter member of the MAA at the time of its founding in 1915, the\nyear she returned to graduate school to complete her doctoral studies. Throughout\nher career she attended many national and sectional meetings; the last was a na-\ntional summer meeting held at Cornell in 1965 celebrating the \ufb01ftieth anniversary\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHOWE - 3\n\nof the founding of the MAA. In 1928 she was treasurer for the New Orleans Con-\nvention of the AAUW, which met at a local hotel April 9\u201312. In the late 1930s, she\nreported that she was president of the local county mathematics club, and that she\nwas organizing a three-year course in mathematics (subvocational) for non-college\nentrance students. At that time she was also a member of a literary society, and she\ndescribed her interests as traveling, music, and gardening. In the mid-1950s, she\nreported her professional interests as teaching methods and educational statistics,\nand noted that she had been a member of the National Education Association.\n\nAccording to her obituary, Howe was founder and former president of the Madi-\nson County Mathematics Association. She was a member of the New York Mathe-\nmatics Teachers Association; the American Association of Junior Colleges; Zeta Tau\nAlpha, a national social sorority; Phi Theta Kappa, an honorary fraternity for men\nand women in two year college education; Daughters of the American Revolution;\nthe League of Women Voters; and the New York State Citizens Council.\n\nHowe moved back to Jordan after her years at Cazenovia. After her return she\nwas a member of the Jordan Study Club, the Jordan Historical Society, and the\nJordan Community Council as well as the First Church of Christ, Scientist, of\nSyracuse. Anna Howe died in 1976 at age ninety-two in a nursing home in Auburn,\nNew York, and was survived by two nephews and a niece. She is buried in Maple\nGrove Cemetery of nearby Jordan, along with her parents, brother, and sister-in-\nlaw. The Howe Mathematics Award at Cazenovia College is given to a student\nwith the highest average who has also demonstrated originality and deep interest\nin mathematics.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA (charter member), NCTM, NEA, AAUW,\nSigma Xi.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1911 Problems in photogrammetry.

June 17, 1880\u2013May 5, 1959.\nShorter Female College (BA 1896), University of Georgia (MA 1919), Uni-\nversity of Missouri (PhD 1927).\n\nRuby Usher Hightower was born near Covington, Georgia, the youngest of four\nsurviving daughters of Amarinth (Sims) (1844\u20131908) and James Richard Hightower\n(1846\u20131933), natives of Georgia. Her father was in the Confederate army during the\nCivil War; her parents married in 1869. Two children died as infants. The other\ndaughters were Minnie (b. 1869), Alma (b. 1871), and Lillie Frances (b. 1874). In\n1880 her father was a farmer, and in 1900 and 1910 he was described as a contractor.\nRuby Hightower attended high school in Jackson, Georgia, before completing\nwork for her bachelor\u2019s degree in the academic year 1895\u201396 at Shorter Female\nCollege (Shorter College after 1923) in Rome, Georgia. In the twenty-three-year\nperiod between her graduation and the resumption of her teaching career at Shorter\nin 1919, she taught and studied at a number of places. She taught at: the grade\nschool, at least in 1908\u201309, and high school in Dublin, Georgia; Central College\n(now closed) of Conway, Arkansas; Alabama Normal College (now the University\nof West Alabama); Cox College, a women\u2019s college in College Park, Georgia, (now\nclosed) at least 1915\u201316; Anderson College (now University), then a women\u2019s college\nin South Carolina, 1916\u201317; and Southwest Baptist College and Hardin College in\nMissouri. She studied at the University of Chicago in 1899, at the University of\nLondon in 1913, and received her master\u2019s degree from the University of Georgia\nin 1919. She was the only one listed as receiving a Master of Arts degree at that\nJune commencement at Georgia.\n\nAfter receiving her master\u2019s degree, Hightower returned to Shorter and remained\nthere, except for a leave of absence in 1924\u201325, until her retirement in 1947. The\ncollege annual of 1920 notes that she was elected fellow in mathematics at the\nUniversity of Missouri for 1919\u201320. Apparently she delayed her entrance to the\ngraduate school there until the summer of 1921. She was resident for \ufb01ve summer\nsessions and was granted a leave to study at Missouri 1924\u201325. She was an honorary\nfellow in mathematics for the year and then returned to Shorter as head of the\ndepartment. She received her PhD with minors in physics and astronomy in 1927.\nWhile at Missouri she wrote her dissertation in ring theory under the direction of\nG. E. Wahlin. According to the Shorter College historian, Hightower was the \ufb01rst\nShorter graduate to receive a PhD degree.\n\nDuring Hightower\u2019s years at Shorter College she was generally the only perma-\nnent member of the mathematics department. Her interests included mathematical\nastronomy and economics. She wrote in 1940, \u201cMy chief interest is in teaching,\nand not in research, for which I have little available time\u201d (Owens questionnaire).\nAfter her retirement in 1947, she spent time with relatives in Quitman and Atlanta,\nbut maintained her apartment on the college campus. She taught part time at the\ncollege 1949\u201350, 1954\u201355, and 1956\u201357, and was emeritus after 1952.\n\nHightower was tall, slender, extremely soft-spoken, and, according to her obit-\nuary in the Shorter College alumni bulletin, \u201can excellent teacher, thoroughly\ngrounded in her subject.\u201d She was a Baptist and a Democrat. She had been living\nat the college apartments in Rome until a few weeks before her death in Quitman,\nGeorgia, in 1959. A niece in Quitman and a great-niece in Rome were among her\nsurvivors.

At the University of Maine, Copeland\nwas a member of Phi Kappa Phi, an honor society for scholarship; in 1921 she was\nnamed an alumna member of Phi Beta Kappa at Maine. She also belonged to Alpha\nOmicron Pi social sorority.\n\nCopeland taught mathematics from 1905 to 1910 in the Bangor high school. She\nthen went to Wellesley College, where she earned a master\u2019s degree in 1911. She\ncontinued her graduate work at the University of Pennsylvania, where she was a\nBennett fellow and a Pepper fellow 1911\u201313. She received her doctorate in 1913\nwith a dissertation in invariant theory directed by Oliver E. Glenn, who had earned\na PhD from Pennsylvania in 1905.\n\nImmediately after receiving her doctorate, Copeland was hired by Wellesley and\nspent the rest of her career there. She was instructor 1913\u201320, assistant professor\n1920\u201328, associate professor 1928\u201337, professor 1937\u201346, and professor emeritus af-\nter her retirement in 1946. Colleagues in the Wellesley mathematics department\nincluded Helen Merrill, who was chair of the department 1916\u201332; Roxana Vivian;\nMabel Minerva Young; Clara Eliza Smith; Marion Stark; and Helen G. Russell. All\nbut Stark and Russell were on the Wellesley faculty when Copeland was a master\u2019s\nstudent there; Stark arrived in 1919 and Russell in 1928. Among Copeland\u2019s teach-\ning responsibilities was a course she developed in the history of mathematics. In\nconnection with this interest she collected rare books, particularly on mathemati-\ncal recreations, for the Treasure Room of the library. Copeland wrote a descriptive\ncatalogue of the rare mathematical books in the Wellesley library and spoke about\nthem several times to the Wellesley mathematics club.\n\nCopeland\u2019s appointments at Wellesley included terms on committees on long-\nterm educational policy; reappointments, promotions and dismissals; curriculum\nand instruction; lectures, which she chaired; and the library. She spoke to Wellesley\nclubs and to various professional associations. Copeland was one of the six members\nof the Wellesley mathematics department who became members of the MAA before\nApril 1, 1916, and, hence, were charter members. She often attended the annual\nand summer meetings of the association and served on the program committees for\nthe annual meetings of 1922 and 1923, chairing the latter. She was the \ufb01rst woman\npresident of the New England Association of Teachers of Mathematics 1925\u201327.\n\nIn the late 1930s, Copeland described herself as a Republican and as Congrega-\ntional. She was on the Service Fund of the Christian Association and was treasurer\nat one time. Copeland\u2019s many interests included attending plays, reading, driving,\nhiking, and traveling. She was a member of the Appalachian Mountain Club and\nserved as a counselor in natural history for the club. Her travels included trips\nto Europe 1930; Alaska 1931; Labrador 1934; Egypt, central Africa, and the Near\nEast 1935; Scandinavia 1936; Mexico 1937; and Puerto Rico 1939. The trip in 1935\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCOPELAND - 2\n\nlasted from mid-February until early June and was made with Clara Eliza Smith,\nher close friend who had retired from the mathematics department at Wellesley the\nsummer before. It included Egypt, Palestine, Syria, Uganda, Turkey, Greece, and\nItaly. In 1937, Copeland wrote to Helen Owens that she would be spending that\nsummer on \u201cMiss Smith\u2019s farm in the hills of Connecticut.\u201d Smith died suddenly\nof a cerebral hemorrhage in May 1943 in the home she shared with Copeland in\nWellesley. At the time of Copeland\u2019s retirement three years later, it was noted in\nthe Wellesley alumnae magazine that \u201cher friendship with Clara E. Smith, a former\nmember of our Mathematics Department, needs no elaboration to those who knew\nthem both. And the courage shown by Miss Copeland, when after Miss Smith\u2019s\ndeath she picked up the shattered plans of her life and rebuilt them beautifully, has\nmade a profound impression on all of us\u201d (Wellesley College Archives).\n\nCopeland was awarded an honorary Doctor of Science degree by the University of\nMaine in 1948. A February 1949 description of the occasion by Carol S. Scott (Mrs.\nWm. C. Scott), a mathematics instructor at St. Petersburg Junior College in Florida\nwho had graduated from Wellesley in 1911, noted that \u201cthe Maine citation especially\nstressed her making mathematics \u2018a joyous adventure\u2019 to her years of classes but\nafter the speech she gave to the almost a thousand banqueting alumni the night\nbefore commencement it could have lauded her ability to \u2018steal the show\u2019 from\nformal lecturers\u201d (Alumni Record Collection; Folder: Copeland, Lennie Phoebe;\nUniversity of Pennsylvania Archives).\n\nFollowing her retirement from Wellesley, Copeland made her home in St. Peters-\nburg with Carol Scott, whom she had known at Wellesley. Lennie Phoebe Copeland\ndied in St. Petersburg in January 1951 at age sixty-nine. The funeral was held in\nSt. Petersburg and was followed by burial in Brewer, Maine. She was survived by\nseveral cousins.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA (charter member), AAAS, Phi Beta Kappa,\nSigma Xi.\n\nDissertation:\n1913 On the theory of invariants of n-lines.

September 14, 1877\u2013June 25, 1974.\nUniversity of Chicago (BS 1911), Universit\u00b4e de Strasbourg (PhD 1930).\n\nMyrtie Collier was born in Carthage, Missouri, the third of four children of\nAngeline (Willson) (b. 1839), of Kentucky, and Ervin Collier (b. 1832), a farmer,\noriginally from Indiana. According to the 1880 and 1900 census records, her parents\nmarried in about 1871 and had two sons, Erwin (b. ca. 1873) and Ellis (b. 1875),\nand two daughters, Myrtie and Josie (b. 1880), all born in Missouri. The household\nin 1880 also included two daughters of her father, Wenona and Mary, ages nineteen\nand seventeen, born in Kansas, presumably from an earlier marriage. Myrtie Collier\nand her younger sister were both listed as teachers in the 1900 census.\n\nAfter obtaining her bachelor\u2019s degree at age thirty-three in 1911 from the Uni-\nversity of Chicago, Collier moved to California to become a mathematics teacher\nand chairman of the department at the Los Angeles State Normal School, prede-\ncessor of the University of California, Los Angeles. The State Normal School was\nestablished in 1881; in 1919 it o\ufb00ered its \ufb01rst instruction at the postsecondary level\nand became the Southern Branch, University of California, a two-year institution.\nIt added a four-year teachers\u2019 curriculum in 1922, a four-year letters and science\ncurriculum in 1923, and awarded its \ufb01rst bachelor\u2019s degree in 1923. While teaching\nat the Normal School, Collier was doing educational experiments and publishing\narticles in the journal School Science and Mathematics. She published one more\narticle in this journal after she received her PhD in 1930.\n\nCollier remained at the Southern Branch of the University of California as chair-\nman of the department through 1920 and as assistant professor from 1920 until\n1928, a year after the school\u2019s name changed to the University of California at Los\nAngeles. She took a year\u2019s leave of absence 1920\u201321 and was for some time in 1920\nan associate in the mathematics department at the University of Chicago. While\nthere she was a member of the program committee for the junior mathematical\nclub at the university for 1920\u201321. In 1928 she left UCLA to pursue further grad-\nuate study and received her PhD cum laude from the University of Strasbourg in\n1930, when she was \ufb01fty-two. She returned to Los Angeles, where she served as\ndepartment chairman at Immaculate Heart College (now closed) from 1930 until\nher retirement in 1947 as professor emeritus. Upon her retirement, the students of\nthe mathematics study club at Immaculate Heart honored her with a dinner for her\nsuccessful service with the college. While at Immaculate Heart she often attended\nmeetings of the AMS held in the Los Angeles area.\n\nCollier was, by her own account, a great traveler. In addition to other trips, she\nwas in Europe in summer 1937. She considered herself a student of the history of\nscience and anthropology, and she enjoyed music. She was a Presbyterian.\n\nMyrtie Collier maintained her residence in Los Angeles until her death of pneu-\nmonia as a consequence of left ventricular failure and longer term heart problems.\nShe died in Good Samaritan Hospital in Los Angeles at age ninety-six in 1974 and\nwas buried in Forest Lawn Memorial Park, in Glendale, California.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA (charter member), AAAS (fellow), Pi Mu Ep-\nsilon.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCOLLIER - 2\n\nDissertation:\n1930 Sur quelques points de la th\u00b4eorie des fonctions enti`eres ou m\u00b4eromorphes d\u2019ordre \ufb01ni;\nGroupes primitifs simplement transitifs de degre\u00b4e vingt et un.

November 18, 1901\u2013March 8, 1985.\nHunter College (BA 1922), Bryn Mawr College (MA 1924, PhD 1927).\n\nLaura Guggenbuhl (often Guggenb\u00a8uhl until the late 1930s) was the younger of\ntwo surviving children (of four born) of Emma Marie (Wildhaber) (b. 1867) and\nFritz Guggenb\u00a8uhl (b. 1859), both natives of Switzerland. Her mother had immi-\ngrated to the United States in 1887, and her father in 1888, about a year before\ntheir marriage. Her brother, Frederick G. W. (1900\u20131984), was born in New Jersey.\nAccording to the 1900 census, in June of that year the parents and infant son were\nliving in Saratoga Springs, New York, where her father was a butcher in a hotel.\nLaura Guggenbuhl was born the next year in New York City; in 1910 the family\nof four was living in Manhattan, and her father was a baker in his own bakery. By\n1920 her mother was widowed, and the census report of that year indicates that\nthe two children and their mother, who was working as a clerk in a bakery, were\nstill living in Manhattan. Laura\u2019s brother, Frederick, became a physician.\n\nLaura Guggenbuhl attended public schools in New York City before entering\nHunter College in 1918. While there she was a member of the mathematics club\nand played basketball. She gave her \ufb01rst talk to the Hunter mathematics club at\nthe end of her \ufb01rst year there. By the end of her second year, she had submitted\nsolutions to problems in the Monthly and about that time organized a \u201cProblem\nChapter\u201d of the mathematics club. She attended Columbia University in summer\n1920 and New York University in 1921. She was a teacher in training at Erasmus\nHall High School in Brooklyn January\u2013June 1922 before receiving her bachelor\u2019s\ndegree with a major in mathematics from Hunter in 1922. She then began her\ngraduate studies in mathematics at Columbia in summer 1922 in classes given by\nW. B. Fite and Dunham Jackson. Guggenbuhl was hired as an instructor at Hunter\nfor the year 1922\u201323 before continuing her graduate studies.\n\nFrom 1923 to 1926 Guggenbuhl studied at Bryn Mawr College, \ufb01rst as a graduate\nscholar in mathematics 1923\u201324 before receiving her master\u2019s degree in 1924. She\nremained at Bryn Mawr as a resident fellow 1924\u201326. She continued to teach at\nHunter during the summers and returned to Hunter as instructor in 1926. The\nfollowing year she received her PhD in mathematics and education from Bryn Mawr\nCollege as Anna Pell Wheeler\u2019s third dissertation student. While at Bryn Mawr she\nalso studied with Charlotte A. Scott and D. V. Widder.\n\nGuggenbuhl remained on the faculty at Hunter College until her retirement in\n1972. She was instructor 1926\u201332, assistant professor 1932\u201359, and associate pro-\nfessor 1959\u201372. Her research interests were largely in the history of mathematics.\nIn 1950 she published her \ufb01rst historical articles: on Gunstock, the home of the\nnineteenth-century American astronomer Asaph Hall, and on Euclidean geometry.\nSeveral articles followed as well as entries in the Dictionary of Scienti\ufb01c Biography\non Henri Brocard and Karl Wilhelm Feuerbach. Between 1966 and 1987 sixty-six of\nher reviews, half of which were in history and biography, appeared in Mathematical\nReviews; almost three-quarters of these were reviews of articles in Russian with the\nothers in German, Italian, and English.\n\nGuggenbuhl reported in the mid-1960s that she had been a consultant for the\nInstitute of Personality Assessment and Research at the University of California,\nBerkeley. She was a member of many professional societies and was a frequent\nparticipant in meetings. She attended the International Congress of Mathematicians\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGUGGENBUHL - 2\n\nin Zurich in 1932, Cambridge (USA) in 1950, Amsterdam in 1954, Edinburgh in\n1958, Stockholm in 1962, Moscow in 1966, and Nice in 1970. She served as o\ufb03cial\ndelegate from Hunter College to the congresses in 1932, 1954, 1962, 1966, and 1970.\nShe made many other trips to Europe as well and reported in Science on two\nmeetings she attended: the July 1955 Congress of the French Association for the\nAdvancement of Science, in Caen, and the September 1961 symposium on topology\nand its relation to modern analysis and algebra, in Prague. She was a member of\nthe New York Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 1939 Guggenbuhl reported her hobbies as travel and photography and her\nfavorite recreations as motoring, swimming, bridge, football, and basketball. She\ntraveled extensively after her retirement and in 1976 participated in a study tour\nto Canton, People\u2019s Republic of China. She was a member of the Metropolitan\nMuseum of Art and the Metropolitan Opera Guild. She was active in Hunter College\nalumnae activities and held a number of o\ufb03ces including treasurer and member of\nthe board of directors of the Scholarship and Welfare Fund. She was particularly\nactive in fund raising. At various times she was a member of the committee for\nthe Bryn Mawr College Endowment Fund; was chairman of the Hunter College\nFaculty Committee on Community Funds; and was chairman of the Ways and\nMeans Committee, which involved fund raising, for the New York City Branch of\nAAUW. She was a Protestant. The last several years of her life she lived in White\nPlains, New York, as did her brother and his wife.\n\nOn May 6, 1985, Laura Guggenbuhl\u2019s sister-in-law wrote to Bryn Mawr College.\n\u201cThis is a di\ufb03cult missive to write. . . .

December 9, 1893\u2013September 16, 1971.\nBrown University (Women\u2019s College) (BA 1916), Brown University (MA 1917),\nCornell University (PhD 1924).\n\nMarian Marsh Torrey was born in Malden, Massachusetts, the daughter of Anna Louise\n(Marsh), born in 1859 in Vermont, and Daniel Temple Torrey, born of missionary par-\nents in 1859 in Fair\ufb01eld, Indian Territory, in what was later northeastern Oklahoma. Her\nparents married in about 1890. Daniel T. Torrey, at one time a Congregational minister\nin Massachusetts, was by 1900 an insurance agent in Providence, Rhode Island, where\nMarian Torrey grew up. Four children were living in 1910 of seven that had been born by\nthat time. The eldest, George Sa\ufb00ord (1891\u20131977), received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1913\nand a master\u2019s degree in 1915 from Harvard and a dipl\u02c6om\u00b4e d\u2019\u00b4etudes sup\u00b4erieures in botany\nfrom the University of Paris in 1919. He was a member of the botany faculty 1915\u201353 at\nConnecticut Agricultural College, which became the University of Connecticut in 1939.\nMarian Torrey\u2019s two younger sisters were Katharine Adelaide (1896\u20131990), who became\na teacher, and Anna St. John (1897\u20131919).\n\nMarian Torrey attended the North\ufb01eld Seminary, a preparatory school for girls in Mas-\nsachusetts, 1909\u201312 before entering Women\u2019s College in Brown University in Providence.\nShe graduated as a mathematics major in 1916. Torrey received the Emma Josephine\nArnold fellowship of $500 for 1916\u201317 to continue her studies at Brown and received her\nmaster\u2019s degree at the end of the year. Letters in the spring of 1917 make it clear that\nTorrey planned to take two or three years o\ufb00 before continuing her work towards a doc-\ntorate and an eventual career in college teaching. Among letters in response to inquiries\nfrom Raymond Clare Archibald of Brown about possible positions for Torrey was one on\nApril 9 from A. E. Young of Miami University in Ohio, noting that \u201cit is against our gen-\neral policy to employ women in the Liberal Arts College\u201d (R. G. D. Richardson Papers,\nCorrespondence, Brown University Archives).\n\nTorrey taught mathematics at the St. Johnsbury Academy in Vermont and then taught\nfor two years at the Phebe Anna Thorne Model School at Bryn Mawr. While teaching\nat the Model School she also took two courses at Bryn Mawr College. She was then an\ninstructor at West Virginia University 1920\u201323. While on the faculty there, she attended\ntwo summer quarters at the University of Chicago, the last in 1923 when she started\na course with E. J. Wilczynski and planned to complete her studies at Chicago under\nhis direction the following year. That summer Wilczynski\u2019s health forced him to give up\nteaching, and, at the suggestion of R. G. D. Richardson at Brown, Torrey wrote to Virgil\nSnyder at Cornell University to inquire about credit for her previous graduate work and\nthe possibility of \ufb01nishing her work at Cornell. She enrolled at Cornell in the fall of 1923\nand received her PhD the following June with a minor in physics. Contact names at that\ntime included her brother George Torrey, Richardson at Brown, and Margaret Buchanan\n(Cole) at West Virginia University.\n\nOn February 13, 1924, while Torrey was \ufb01nishing her doctoral work at Cornell, R. G.\nD. Richardson at Brown wrote a letter in her behalf to Ruth Goulding Wood at Smith. In\nit, he said, \u201cThe department [at Brown] feels that we have never had, among the twenty or\nmore girls whom we have sent out to teach in colleges, any stronger candidate. She comes\nfrom a cultured family, has a rare gift of getting along with people, and is very competent\nmathematically. . . . If Brown University would employ women, I would not hesitate to\nask President Faunce to call her here at a good salary. She would do much better than\nmany of the men whom we have at present on our sta\ufb00\u201d (R. G. D. Richardson Papers,\nCorrespondence 1921\u20131925, Folder W, Brown University Archives).\n\nAfter receiving her PhD, Torrey spent one year as an instructor at the University of\nIllinois before going to Goucher College as an instructor in 1925. She was promoted to\nassistant professor in 1927, to associate professor in 1932, and to professor in 1942. She\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nTORREY - 2\n\nspent a sabbatical year, 1931\u201332, studying at Columbia University. While at Goucher she\nserved as chairman of the department 1943\u201357; assistant to the dean for academic a\ufb00airs\n1937\u201343; and head of a resident dormitory, Baldwin House, 1942\u201359. She retired from\nGoucher in 1959. Goucher\u2019s annual banquet of the Mathematics Club and its prize for\noutstanding scholarship in mathematics are named in her honor.\n\nTorrey began attending meetings of the MAA before she received her doctorate and\ncontinued attending for at least thirty years. She served as chair of the Maryland\u2013District\nof Columbia\u2013Virginia Section 1952\u201353 and on the arrangements committees for the annual\nmeetings of the AMS and the MAA held at Johns Hopkins University in December 1953.\nIn the late 1930s Torrey described her church a\ufb03liation as Congregational. She men-\ntioned renovating old houses as a hobby and listed bridge, bowling, and walking as favorite\nrecreations. Torrey died in her apartment in Towson, Maryland, at the age of seventy-seven\nin 1971.\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, IMS, Sigma Delta Epsilon, AAUP, Phi Beta\nKappa, Sigma Xi.\n\nDissertation:\n1924 Classi\ufb01cation of monoidal involutions having a \ufb01xed tangent cone.

July 22, 1887\u2013January 22, 1969.\nUniversity of Illinois (BA 1909, MA 1911, PhD 1913).\n\nJosephine Elizabeth Burns was born in Greenville, Illinois, the daughter of Ida\nJane (Carey) (1856\u20131929) of Ohio and James Clinton Burns (1850\u20131930) of Penn-\nsylvania. Her father graduated in 1875 from Monmouth College, had a master\u2019s\ndegree, and was later a professor of history at the Western Illinois State Normal\nSchool (now Western Illinois University) at Macomb. Her parents, who were col-\nlege classmates, were married in 1878, and there were four children in the family:\nClinton (1880\u20131939); Deane, born March 1884; Josephine; and Ruth, born August\n1890. Deane and Ruth received bachelor\u2019s degrees from Illinois in 1907 and 1911,\nrespectively. Deane Burns became a chemical engineer, and Clinton Burns was a\nretired executive of Standard Oil Company in China at the time of his death.\n\nJosephine Burns prepared in the Monmouth and Macomb high schools and at-\ntended Western Illinois State Normal School 1904\u201306, shortly after it was estab-\nlished at the turn of the century and before it granted degrees. As an undergraduate\nat the University of Illinois she was a member of the Illiola Literary Society for\nwomen and the education honor society Kappa Delta Pi. Burns graduated in 1909,\nhaving earned Final Honors.\n\nJosephine Burns remained at Illinois as a graduate student and held a mathe-\nmatics scholarship in 1910\u201311. After earning her master\u2019s degree in 1911, she held a\nfellowship in mathematics at the University of Wisconsin 1911\u201312 and at the Uni-\nversity of Illinois 1912\u201313. She received her PhD from Illinois in 1913. Her work in\ngroup theory for her master\u2019s thesis and her doctoral dissertation at Illinois resulted\nin a historical paper in the Monthly and a paper in the American Journal of Mathe-\nmatics. For several years after its publication, her paper in the Monthly was among\nthose listed when the editors publicized the historical papers they had published.\nHer PhD dissertation was directed by G. A. Miller, and it is likely that Miller, who\nhad come to Illinois in 1906, also directed her master\u2019s thesis. Her critical reading\nof the page proofs of Miller\u2019s contribution to Miller, Blichfeldt, and Dickson\u2019s 1916\nTheory and Applications of Finite Groups was acknowledged in the preface of that\nbook.\n\nBurns remained at Illinois as instructor 1913\u201315, 1918\u201320, \ufb01rst semester 1924\u201325,\nand 1925\u201326. On June 15, 1916, in Macomb, she married Robert Douglass Glasgow.\nGlasgow, born in Tennessee, Illinois, on April 3, 1879, had earned a BA in 1908\nand a PhD in 1913 in entomology at the University of Illinois. He also remained at\nIllinois after obtaining his doctorate: as instructor 1913\u201324 and as associate 1924\u2013\n28. While a student he served as a \ufb01rst lieutenant and a captain in the University\nRegiment and later served as a brevet (temporary) captain in the Illinois National\nGuard.\n\nWhile the Glasgows were still at Illinois, Josephine B. Glasgow and Mary Gertrude\nHaseman, who was instructor there 1920\u201328, prepared a mimeographed freshman\nmathematics text. This work is likely to have formed the basis for the paper they\nread in 1926 to the Illinois Section of the MAA.\n\nIn 1928 Robert D. Glasgow took a position as state entomologist for New York,\nso they moved to Albany where they remained. In this position he was involved\nwith pest control and later was particularly active in the Mosquito Control Associ-\nation. Also in 1928, Josephine Burns Glasgow served as national secretary of Sigma\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGLASGOW - 2\n\nDelta Epsilon and represented that society in the council of the AAAS. While in Al-\nbany, she was active in the AAUW and in 1932 represented the state AAUW when\nthe state Women\u2019s Joint Legislative Forum was organized. She became secretary-\ntreasurer of the state AAUW in 1940, vice president of the North Atlantic region\nin 1947, and was appointed to the national board of directors as vice president in\n1952. In 1951 the Albany branch named a fellowship in her honor.\n\nThe Glasgows had no children. They were particularly knowledgeable about ferns\nand mushrooms, and in the summer of 1954 Josephine Glasgow led one day of a\nsix-day \ufb01eld trip organized by the American Fern Society.\n\nRobert Glasgow retired in 1949, having reached the mandatory retirement age\nof seventy. He then served as a consultant to a \ufb01rm in the Philippines. He died in\nAlbany on July 15, 1964.\n\nJosephine B. Glasgow died in or near Albany, New York, at age eighty-one in\nJanuary 1969.

February 22, 1875\u2013August 8, 1936.\nUniversity of Mount Allison College (BA 1899), Cornell University (MA\n1900, PhD 1924).\n\nJulia Trueman Colpitts was born in Pointe de Bute, New Brunswick, Canada,\nthe third of eight children of Celia Eliza (Trueman) (1848\u20131930) and James Wal-\nlace Colpitts (ca. 1844\u20131919), who married in 1871. The family was from a long\nline of farm families in New Brunswick. The children were Edwin Henry (1872\u2013\n1949), Andrew Weldon (1874\u20131901), Julia, Albert James (1876\u20131950), Elmer Clif-\nford (1879\u20131963), Laura Jane (1882\u20131948), Walter Howard (1886\u20131972), and Mary\nAlice (1892\u20131920).\n\nSeveral of the children went into teaching or scienti\ufb01c careers. Edwin, the el-\ndest, \ufb01rst attended normal school in New Brunswick before earning a bachelor\u2019s\ndegree at Mount Allison and an additional BA and an MS at Harvard. He was a\ndistinguished communications engineer whose career was with the American Bell\nTelephone Company. Elmer C. Colpitts earned a PhD in mathematics from Cornell\nUniversity in 1906 as a student of Virgil Snyder. His retirement from the State Col-\nlege of Washington (now Washington State University) was reported in 1950. Mary\nColpitts, who also studied at Mount Allison, was an instructor of mathematics at\nthe University of Wisconsin when she died of tuberculosis at age twenty-eight.\n\nJulia Colpitts attended the public high school at Pointe de Bute and the normal\nSchool at Fredericton, New Brunswick, from which she graduated. She graduated\nfrom the University of Mount Allison College in 1899 with honors in mathematics.\nThe next year she studied at Cornell University where she earned her master\u2019s\ndegree in 1900.\n\nAfter receiving her master\u2019s degree, Colpitts joined the faculty at Iowa State\nCollege of Agriculture and Mechanic Arts (now Iowa State University of Science\nand Technology) as an instructor. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1906\nand to associate professor in 1913. Colpitts studied at the University of Chicago\nduring the summer of 1912, at Columbia University during the summer of 1915, and\nagain at Chicago during the summer of 1919. In addition, she took many graduate\ncourses at Iowa State for which she received no credit since she was a member of\nthe faculty. She coauthored an analytic geometry textbook with Maria Roberts, her\nmathematics department colleague and with whose family she was boarding at the\ntime of the 1910 census. The book \ufb01rst appeared in 1918, with a second edition in\n1926.\n\nIn addition to taking graduate courses at Iowa State, Colpitts had also taught\ngraduate courses by the time she applied to Cornell in February 1922. Included\namong her letters of recommendation was one of March 15, 1922, from a former\nstudent who had done graduate work at Wisconsin, Yale, and Columbia. This stu-\ndent felt that Colpitts was surpassed by no other teacher of mathematics \u201cwith the\nsingle exception of Professor Pierpont of Yale\u201d (Mary G. Miller to J. H. Tanner,\nGraduate School Records, Division of Rare and Manuscript Collections, Cornell\nUniversity Library).\n\nIn 1922\u201323 Colpitts was granted a leave from Iowa State in order to study at\nCornell. During that year she took a number of courses and worked on a dissertation\nwith C. F. Craig. She then returned to Iowa State and remained on the faculty\nfor the rest of her career. In early 1924 Craig went on leave to Europe, and J.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCOLPITTS - 2\n\nI. Hutchinson replaced him as the chairman of her doctoral committee. Colpitts\nreceived her PhD in 1924 at age forty-nine with her major analysis, \ufb01rst minor\ngeometry, and second minor philosophy. In the summer of 1929 she did further\nstudies at the University of Chicago.\n\nColpitts held leadership positions in a number of professional organizations. She\nwas national secretary in 1926 and national president in 1927 of Sigma Delta Ep-\nsilon, the graduate women\u2019s scienti\ufb01c fraternity. She then became active in the Iowa\nSection of the MAA and served as vice chairman 1928\u201329 and 1932\u201333 and as chair-\nman 1935\u201336. She was a member of the Iowa Academy of Science and was chair of\nthe mathematics section for the April 1936 meeting of the academy. She attended\nthe International Congress of Mathematicians in Toronto in 1924, in Bologna in\n1928, and in Oslo in 1936.\n\nJulia Colpitts was scheduled to depart for the United States from Hamburg\non August 6, 1936, after the Oslo congress but became ill and died on August 8\nin Southampton, England.

May 31, 1899\u2013March 28, 1948.\nConcordia College (BA 1920), University of Chicago (MA 1923, PhD 1936).\n\nMae Ruth Anderson was born near Westby, Wisconsin, the daughter of Ida\n(Berg) (1862\u20131942) and Norton Alfred Anderson (1862\u20131930), both natives of Wis-\nconsin of Norwegian ancestry. Her parents married in about 1894; it was a second\nmarriage for Ida Anderson and a \ufb01rst for Norton Anderson. In 1900 Ida Anderson\nhad two surviving children of three born; her son from her \ufb01rst marriage was born in\n1887 in South Dakota and was living with the family in Vernon County, Wisconsin,\nin 1900 but not in later census years. Norton Anderson was a merchant.\n\nSometime after 1910 Mae Ruth Anderson and her parents moved to Shelly in\nwestern Minnesota, where her father again owned a store. Anderson graduated from\nhigh school in Halstad, Minnesota, a few miles from Shelly, in 1916 before entering\nConcordia College in neighboring Moorhead, Minnesota.\n\nWhen Anderson was at Concordia, 1916\u201320, the mathematics department con-\nsisted of two faculty members, one of whom was Martha Brennun, who in 1917 was\nthe \ufb01rst woman to receive a bachelor\u2019s degree from Concordia. Brennun, a mathe-\nmatics major, had started teaching immediately after her graduation. At Concordia,\nAnderson was a member of the Alpha Society, Concordia\u2019s major scholastic honor\nsociety, and was on the sta\ufb00 of the Crescent, the student newspaper. A fellow stu-\ndent of Anderson\u2019s was Ruth B. Rasmusen, who was at Concordia 1918\u201321 and\nwho received her PhD from Chicago in 1936, as did Anderson.\n\nAfter her graduation from Concordia in 1920, Anderson taught in high school in\nGayville, South Dakota, for a year before beginning her master\u2019s work in mathemat-\nics at the University of Chicago in the fall of 1921. After six consecutive quarters,\nshe received the MA in March 1923.

October 20, 1898\u2013November 14, 1962.\nUniversity of Wisconsin (BA 1931, MA 1933, PhD 1935).\n\nLouise Adelaide Wolf was the elder of two daughters, both born in Milwaukee, Wis-\nconsin, of Caroline (Kupperian) (1875\u20131973) and John Theodore Wolf (1872\u20131953). Her\nmother, who was born in Germany and immigrated to the United States in 1892, and her\nfather, born in Milwaukee, were married in January 1898. Both were formally educated\nthrough elementary school. In the 1900 census, her father\u2019s occupation was listed as con-\nductor on the street railroad; later he was a truck gardener. Her younger sister, Margarete\nWolf (Hopkins), was born in November 1911 and also received a PhD in mathematics from\nWisconsin in 1935.\n\nLouise Wolf attended the 26th Avenue School and, for three and a half years, South\nDivision High School, in Milwaukee. She attended Milwaukee-Downer College in 1915\u201316.\nShe then took a number of positions over the next dozen years. These included working in\na dental o\ufb03ce and in a public library in Milwaukee, teaching two years in a district school\nin Nevada, and working two years in Florida. She returned to college at the Milwaukee\nExtension Division of the University of Wisconsin for the year 1928\u201329, when her younger\nsister began college there. They both moved to the Madison campus the following year\nto complete their undergraduate and graduate work. Louise Wolf was a member of the\njunior mathematics club her junior and senior years in Madison and was its president her\nsenior year.\n\nIn October of her senior year, Warren Weaver wrote to the dean to request an assist-\nantship for Louise Wolf. He noted that Miss Wolf was a senior mathematics major with\na straight A record in math. He ordinarily would not appoint a senior to such a position\nbut \u201cMiss Wolf is an exceedingly capable woman, over 30 years of age, who has had expe-\nrience in teaching and whose university education has been delayed by the fact that she is\nhelping educate a younger sister\u201d (Warren Weaver to Dean Sellery, October 1, 1930, folder\n1929\u201331, box 1, Budget Files, Department of Mathematics, College of Letters and Science,\nUniversity of Wisconsin\u2013Madison Archives). Louise Wolf taught a course as an assistant\nduring the \ufb01rst semester of her senior year and most subsequent semesters while she was\na student at Wisconsin. Typically she taught about three courses a year. She received her\nbachelor\u2019s degree in 1931 and \ufb01nished the work for her master\u2019s degree in 1933. During\nher \ufb01rst year as a graduate student, the mathematics department, acting as a sustaining\nmember of the AMS, nominated her for membership in the society. Louise Wolf and her\nsister, Margarete, \ufb01nished the work for their doctorates in 1935, both as students of Mark\nH. Ingraham. In the early 1950s results from her dissertation and its published version,\n1936, were cited by several authors.\n\nLouise Wolf immediately took a position with the University of Wisconsin\u2019s Extension\nDivision. She was engaged in circuit teaching her \ufb01rst year and traveled regularly between\nMilwaukee, Fond du Lac, Sheboygan, and Manitowoc giving instruction. Starting in 1936,\nshe taught at the Milwaukee Center, often referred to as the University of Wisconsin in\nMilwaukee. Around the beginning of War War II she was also a lecturer at the University of\nWisconsin in Madison. In Milwaukee she was an instructor 1935\u201338, an assistant professor\nuntil 1951, and an associate professor until her retirement as associate professor emeritus\nin January 1962. In 1955 the Extension Division had merged with Wisconsin State College\nto form the University of Wisconsin\u2013Milwaukee.\n\nAt her institution Louise Wolf served as faculty advisor to the junior mathematics club\nseveral times in the 1930s. She and her sister prepared a talk for presentation to the AMS\nin 1938. In the 1940s she became active in the Wisconsin Section of the MAA, initially\nserving on program committees. She was \ufb01rst elected secretary of the section in 1948 and\nserved in that capacity for the next \ufb01ve years.

August 19, 1902\u2013May 14, 1982.\nVassar College (BA 1922), Columbia University (MA 1925), Radcliffe College\n(PhD 1932).\n\nElizabeth Frances Thorndike, known as Frances, was born in New York City,\nthe eldest child of Elizabeth (Moulton) (b. 1878) and Edward L. Thorndike (1874\u2013\n1949), both originally from Massachusetts. She came from a distinguished academic\nfamily. Her mother had taken the four-year classical course at Boston University,\nwhile her father, who had studied with William James at Harvard, earned a PhD\nfrom Columbia in 1898 and became one of the most in\ufb02uential educational psychol-\nogists of the \ufb01rst four decades of the twentieth century. He was on the faculty at\nTeachers College, Columbia University, 1904\u201340; among his numerous books were\none on the psychology of arithmetic and another on the psychology of algebra. Her\nfather was one of four children, all of whom were college graduates and teachers.\nHis two brothers were Ashley Horace (1871\u20131933), who received a PhD in litera-\nture from Harvard in 1898, and (Everett) Lynn (1882\u20131965), whose 1905 PhD from\nColumbia was in history. Both taught at Columbia. His sister, Mildred Thorndike\n(1888\u20131975), was a teacher.\n\nElizabeth Moulton and Edward L. Thorndike married on August 29, 1900. In\n1904, two years after Frances Thorndike\u2019s birth, a second daughter was born but\nlived less than two weeks. Three sons followed: Edward Moulton (1905\u20131991),\nRobert Ladd (1910\u20131990), and Alan Moulton (1918\u20132006). All of the children even-\ntually earned PhD\u2019s: Edward in physics from the California Institute of Technology\nin 1930, Robert in psychology from Columbia University in 1935, and Alan in\nphysics from Harvard University in 1947.\n\nFrances Thorndike \ufb01rst attended the Horace Mann School, a private school as-\nsociated with Teachers College, Columbia University, that had opened as a coed-\nucational school in 1887 and remained so for about twenty-\ufb01ve years. Thorndike\nalso went to the public school in Montrose, New York, and then to Drum Hill\nHigh School in Peekskill, New York. She attended Vassar College and, according to\nher father\u2019s biographer, impressed psychologist Margaret Washburne as the most\nbrilliant student she had ever had. After Thorndike\u2019s graduation from Vassar in\n1922, she worked as an engineering assistant at the American Telephone and Tele-\ngraph Company in New York City 1922\u201324 and again 1925\u201327, after taking the\nyear 1924\u201325 to earn a master\u2019s degree in mathematics from Columbia University.\nFrances Thorndike became instructor of physics at Vassar for the year 1927\u201328\nand studied at Radcli\ufb00e College in 1928\u201329 as a Vassar alumnae fellow. On June\n29, 1929, Frances Thorndike married Thomas Freeman Cope. Cope was born in\nTexas in 1900, earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1923 and a master\u2019s degree in 1925\nfrom Tulane University, and received his PhD in mathematics from the University\nof Chicago in 1927. He was at Harvard for the year 1928\u201329 as a National Research\nCouncil fellow. They remained in Cambridge the year after their marriage, he as\ninstructor of mathematics at Harvard.\n\nIn 1930 the Copes moved to Ohio, where T. Freeman Cope was head of the\nmathematics department at Marietta College until 1937. Frances T. Cope completed\nher work for the PhD at Radcli\ufb00e as a student of George David Birkho\ufb00 in 1932.\nThe publications resulting from her dissertation continue to be cited in mathematics\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCOPE - 2\n\nand physics literature. The Copes had three children: Freeman Widener (1930\u2013\n1982); Elizabeth Frances, born in 1934; and Mary Thorndike, born in 1935. Freeman\nearned an MD from the Johns Hopkins University in 1955, and Elizabeth earned a\nPhD from Harvard in psychotherapy in 1963.\n\nFrances Cope was an instructor of mathematics at Vassar College during second\nsemester 1935\u201336. In 1937 the family moved to New York, and T. Freeman Cope\njoined the faculty at Queens College. He was assistant professor 1937\u201339, associate\nprofessor 1939\u201348, professor 1948\u201370, and department chairman 1937\u201350 and 1952\u2013\n69. He also served as an expert consultant on mathematics tests for the Adjutant\nGeneral\u2019s O\ufb03ce 1944\u201346. Frances T. Cope served as instructor at Queens in 1941\nand at Adelphi College 1941\u201343.\n\nFrances Cope was a member of the Vassar Club and the auxiliary of the Peek-\nskill, New York, Community Hospital.

It appears that she taught for a year there before entering Colorado College\nin Colorado Springs, where she earned her bachelor\u2019s degree cum laude in 1909.\nFlorian Cajori was the head professor of mathematics there at that time. While at\nColorado College, her activities included Hypatia (a literary and social club), the\nDramatic Society, Dais, the YWCA, and the YWCA cabinet. After her graduation,\nshe returned to Centennial High School, where she taught history 1909\u201311 and\nthen mathematics until about 1916. She is listed in all of the school yearbooks\n1909\u20131916 except for the year 1914\u201315. She is listed as being at a high school in\nPueblo in the April 1916 list of charter members of the MAA. The membership\nlist published later that year lists her as a graduate student at the University\nof California living in a hotel in Berkeley. Her master\u2019s thesis, written under the\ndirection of J. H.

She was at Mills a year and a half before resigning in\nJanuary 1925. She and her master\u2019s thesis advisor, John Hector McDonald (1874\u2013\n1953), had married on December 19, 1924, when she was head resident of Mills Hall\nand on the faculty at Mills. J. H. McDonald was born in Toronto, Ontario, Canada,\nearned his PhD as a student of Oskar Bolza at the University of Chicago in 1900,\nand joined the faculty at California in January 1902.\n\nIn May 1932 Emma Whiton McDonald took her \ufb01nal exam for her PhD at the\nUniversity of California. Her dissertation in number theory was directed by D. N.\nLehmer, and her minor subject was astronomy.\n\nEmma Whiton McDonald used the name Mrs. J. H.

Her\nparents were born in Pennsylvania as were her older sister, Margaret (1898\u20131986),\nand brother, William H. (b. 1902). Her mother was born a Catholic and her father\na Lutheran, but the children were raised with no religious a\ufb03liation. Her father\nearned a bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Pennsylvania and a master\u2019s\ndegree from Columbia University. He taught mathematics at the High School of\nCommerce in New York City and after 1929 was on the faculty of the School of\nCommerce, Accounts and Finance of New York University, from which he retired as\nprofessor emeritus in 1948. Her father served for many years as an associate editor\nof the o\ufb03cial journal of the National Council of Teachers of Mathematics and held\nthe title honorary president of that organization after his retirement.\n\nHelen M. Schlauch graduated from high school in Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey,\nin 1924. She then attended Washington Square College of New York University on\na scholarship and graduated in 1928 with a major in mathematics and minors in\nEnglish and psychology. At NYU she was a member of the women\u2019s honor society\nEclectic and of the sorority Alpha Omicron Pi, serving as president of the Pan\nHellenic Council her junior year. She also participated in the Dramatics Society\n1924\u201328 and the Varsity Women\u2019s Debating Team 1925\u201328.\n\nFollowing her graduation from NYU, Schlauch studied at Cornell University and\nreceived a master\u2019s degree in 1929. For the next several years, she was on the faculty\nat Hunter College in New York City and continued her graduate work at Columbia\nand Cornell. She was at Hunter as tutor 1929\u201331 and instructor 1931\u201332, while also\ntaking a course yearly at Columbia during these years. During the summers of 1930\nand 1931, she was registered for informal study at Cornell with Virgil Snyder.\n\nIn May 1932 Helen Schlauch married Leonard Palmer Adams (1906\u20132000), who\nwas studying for a PhD in labor economics at Cornell. L. P. Adams had received\nhis bachelor\u2019s degree from Alfred University in 1928 and his master\u2019s degree from\nCornell in 1930. In June 1932 Helen Schlauch Adams returned to Cornell as a\nscholar and took her PhD examination in July 1933 with major geometry, \ufb01rst\nminor algebra, and second minor electricity. Her dissertation in algebraic geometry\nwas done under Snyder\u2019s supervision. L. P. Adams was at Cornell through 1934.\nHe was an instructor at Colgate University 1934\u201335, received his doctorate from\nCornell in February 1935, and was a research associate at the Central States Board\nin Washington 1935\u201336. They were divorced in 1936; there were no children.\n\nHelen Adams remained on the faculty of Hunter as an instructor 1931\u201341. At a\n1938 meeting of the AMS, she met the Polish-born and -educated theoretical physi-\ncist, Leopold Infeld (1898\u20131968), who taught for eight years in Jewish secondary\nschools in Poland after receiving his PhD in 1921 from the University of Krakow.\nAfter \ufb01ve years at the University of Lwow (then in Poland, now Lviv, Ukraine) and\na year as a Rockefeller Foundation fellow at Cambridge, England, he came to the\nInstitute for Advanced Study in Princeton. When he met Helen Adams he had just\npublished The Evolution of Physics with Albert Einstein and was about to go to\nCanada to teach at the University of Toronto on the applied mathematics faculty.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nINFELD - 2\n\nDuring 1938\u201339 he often traveled from Toronto to New York to see Helen Adams.\nThey were married in New Jersey on April 12, 1939, and had two children, Eric S.\n(b. 1940) and Joan M. (b. 1943), both born in Toronto.\n\nWhile on the applied mathematics faculty, and later the mathematics faculty,\nof the University of Toronto, Leopold Infeld actively campaigned against nuclear\nweapons. After spending the summer of 1949 in Warsaw, he announced that he\nwanted to spend 1950\u201351 in his native Poland lecturing at the University of Warsaw.\nShortly thereafter he was accused of being an atomic spy. In May 1950 he left for\nPoland in a move that he later announced would be permanent; he resigned his\nprofessorship at Toronto in August 1950.\n\nLeopold Infeld\u2019s description of this part of his life appears in his book Why I\nLeft Canada, which was translated by Helen Infeld. He had described his earlier\nlife in the Jewish ghetto of Krakow in Quest: An Autobiography, which was \ufb01rst\npublished in 1941 and which appeared in a second edition in 1980. He was also the\nauthor of the 1948 \ufb01ctional biography of Evariste Galois, Whom the Gods Love, and\nthe 1950 Albert Einstein, His Work and Its In\ufb02uence on Our World. In Warsaw\nLeopold Infeld became the director of the Theoretical Physics Institute and served\nin this position until his death in 1968. In Poland he was critical of censorship by\nthe Polish government. In 1995 he was posthumously awarded the rank of professor\nemeritus from the University of Toronto.\n\nBefore the family emigrated to Poland, Helen Infeld served in various positions\nin the Ajax division of the University of Toronto. The Ajax campus was created\nfrom a massive munitions plant after the war to help accommodate the returning\nveterans and was in existence for three and a half years. She was both assistant and\nreader the \ufb01rst six months of 1946 followed by assistant 1946\u201347 and instructor\n1947\u201349, after which the Ajax campus was closed and she was unemployed. At\nthe end of 1948 she described her life in Canada to her master\u2019s thesis supervisor,\nWalter B. Carver, in a letter that is in an envelope pasted to the back cover of the\narchival copy of her 1929 master\u2019s thesis.\n\nI\u2019ve gone back to work. After giving up one job to come to Toronto\nwith Leopold, and getting two children beyond babyhood, I found\nmyself with a wonderful opportunity to have what I\u2019d always wanted.\nThe returning veterans so increased the student body, that the En-\ngineering School here took over a former defense plant and turned\nit into a college for the \ufb01rst two years of engineering \u2013 twenty miles\nfrom town. There I have been teaching Calculus for the past 3 1\n2\nyears, while a very nice housekeeper kept things going at home.\nI teach part-time and am home several days a week \u2013 I see the\nchildren when they come in from play, and I\u2019m having a wonderful\ntime. The veterans are \ufb01ne to work with, and most appreciative.\n(Cornell University Archives)\n\nHelen Infeld sailed for Poland in July 1950, her \ufb01rst trip outside of North Amer-\nica. The following year her sister, Margaret, a linguist on the faculty of New York\nUniversity, joined the Infelds in Poland and, as reported in her obituary in the\nNew York Times, left the United States \u201csaying she wished to avoid persecution\nfor pro-Communist views.\u201d Margaret Schlauch served as professor and head of the\nEnglish department of Warsaw University until 1967. The cold war atmosphere of\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nINFELD - 3\n\nthe 1950s caused the Canadian government to cancel the Infeld children\u2019s citizen-\nship in December 1958 when they were \ufb01fteen and eighteen. Their daughter left\nPoland in 1974 and was living in Ontario, Canada, in the early 1990s. Their son, a\nprofessor of physics at the Solton Institute in Warsaw who was educated at Trinity\nCollege, Cambridge, and Warsaw University and who publishes under the name\nEryk Infeld, spent some time at the Centre de recherches math\u00b4ematiques of the\nUniversit\u00b4e de Montr\u00b4eal in the early 1990s.\n\nHer son reported that Helen Infeld \u201cfaced the challenge of bringing up a family\nin a country that was completely new to her\u201d and that \u201cdevotion to her family . . .\nled to diminishing interest in mathematics (other than through her husband and\nson)\u201d (authors\u2019 questionnaire 1991). Leopold Infeld had a heart condition and in\n1959 su\ufb00ered a stroke. Their son credits his father\u2019s survival to his mother\u2019s care.\nIn 1965\u201366 Helen and Leopold Infeld spent \ufb01ve months in the United States,\nliving in Dallas, Texas, while Leopold Infeld was a visiting professor at the South-\nwest Center for Advanced Studies (now part of the University of Texas at Dallas).\nThey then returned to Poland. After Leopold Infeld\u2019s death in 1968, and until 1982,\nHelen Infeld served as editor of Poland (A Monthly), the English-language version\nof a periodical devoted to cultural events in Poland.\n\nHelen Infeld was a member of the Polish-Icelandic Society. She received Poland\u2019s\nGold Cross of Merit in 1954 and in 1970 the Chevalier Cross, Polonia Restituta, one\nof the highest distinctions awarded by the Polish government. She died in Warsaw\nin 1993 shortly before her eighty-sixth birthday.

      "text": "PEPPER, Echo D. June 3, 1897\u2013January 5, 1979.\nUniversity of Washington (BS 1920, MS 1922), University of Chicago (PhD\n1925).\n\nEcho Delores Pepper was the second child of Josephine LaBena (Sanderson)\n(1872\u20131930) and Albert Ephraim Pepper (1872\u20131944). Her mother and father were\nborn and married in Ontario, Canada. They were in the process of moving to the\nUnited States when her older sister, Leah H. (1896\u20131966), was born on a Native\nAmerican reservation in Canada. Just after Echo Pepper\u2019s birth in Spokane, Wash-\nington, the family moved to Seattle where her parents and older sister remained\nthe rest of their lives. At various times other relatives lived with them; her father\u2019s\nyounger sister was with them in 1900 as was his seventeen-year-old nephew from\nCanada in 1920. Both parents were trained as accountants, and after working one\nyear as a bookkeeper in the United States, her father was self-employed and her\nmother helped in his businesses. Until the Depression they were very successful run-\nning \ufb01rst a plumbing company and a funeral home and, later, hotels and apartment\nhouses. Echo Pepper\u2019s brother, Vincent A., was born in May 1927. In the 1930s her\nfather had a sheep ranch outside of Seattle that he traded for an apartment house.\nWhen Echo Pepper was seven, she was ill and lost the use of her right hip, al-\nthough an operation improved the situation so that she could walk without crutches\nby about the time she entered high school. She received all of her education in Seat-\ntle until she was twenty-\ufb01ve. She was taught at home for several years because of\nher hip problem. She also attended a convent school, Holy Names Academy, and\nthen a public high school, Franklin High School, from which she graduated in 1916.\nShe then attended the University of Washington, where she studied mathematics\nand physics under E. T. Bell among others for her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s work.\nPepper received her BS in 1920 and held a teaching fellowship in mathematics\nthere in 1920\u201322. She received her MS in 1922 with a thesis referred to as having\n\u201cexceptional merit\u201d in Constance Reid\u2019s biography of Bell (The Search for E. T.\nBell, 192). In the summer of 1922 Pepper studied with G. D. Birkho\ufb00 and L. E.\nDickson at the University of California. In 1922\u201323 she served as an associate at\nthe University of Washington, replacing a faculty member who was on leave.\n\nDuring the years 1923\u201325 Pepper was a fellow at the University of Chicago. On\nAugust 28, 1924, E. T. Bell, who had taught during the summer quarter at Chicago,\nreported to E. H. Moore that \u201cMiss Pepper is wholly absorbed in the topic which\nMr. Dickson assigned her. I believe she is young enough, and su\ufb03ciently ambitious,\nto prosper by a chance to study with G. H. Hardy, provided the opportunity be given\nher. By the end of this year she should have mastered the rudiments of research.\nIn my own stu\ufb00 she has done \ufb01ne work\u201d (folder 8, box 1, E. H. Moore Papers,\nUniversity of Chicago Archives, Special Collections Research Center). Pepper\u2019s work\nas a student of Dickson resulted in her dissertation, \u201cTheory of algebras over a\nquasi-\ufb01eld,\u201d and in 1925\u201326, the year after her PhD (awarded December 1925), she\nstudied with Hardy and A. S. Besicovitch at Oxford University as a holder of a\nNational Research Council fellowship.\n\nUpon Pepper\u2019s return from England she went to Bryn Mawr College as instruc-\ntor for the years 1926\u201328. While there she taught trigonometry, calculus, advanced\ncalculus, di\ufb00erential equations, and number theory and taught at both the under-\ngraduate and graduate levels.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nPEPPER - 2\n\nIn 1928 Echo D. Pepper moved to the University of Illinois where she remained\nmost of the rest of her career. She was instructor 1928\u201329 and associate (similar\nto senior instructor) 1929\u201345. During this period she was active in Sigma Delta\nEpsilon, a society for graduate women in science, and served as national treasurer\nin 1937 and 1938 and as \ufb01rst vice president in 1944 and 1945. Later, in 1955-57,\nshe served as the business manager of the Pi Mu Epsilon Journal. She also was a\nmember of the Illinois Academy of Science.\n\nIn the summer of 1945 Pepper applied for a leave of absence to be in Seattle for\nthe year 1945\u201346, in order to spend time with her family following her father\u2019s death\nand also to be in the less harsh climate. The university president denied the request\nbut indicated that the department might wish to have a formal understanding that\nshe would be reappointed after the year. Thus, Pepper was in Seattle in 1945\u201346\nand while there taught mathematics and physics as assistant professor at Seattle\nCollege (now University) at the time that her brother was a student there. She\nreturned to Illinois in 1946 as assistant professor and remained in that rank until\n1960.\n\nDuring the spring of 1952 Pepper had a corrective bone operation and was\ngranted a leave for the fall semester of 1952\u201353. From about that time she was\nconnected with the rehabilitation program at the University of Illinois. She was the\nchaperon of a wheelchair basketball team at the university and was later awarded\nan honorary life membership in Delta Sigma Omicron, a rehabilitation service fra-\nternity on the Illinois campus.\n\nPepper taught some summers at Southern Illinois University in Carbondale to\ninstruct teachers how to teach the \u201cnew math.\u201d In the spring of 1960 Pepper was\nconsidering moving to Southern Illinois at a considerably higher salary than she was\nmaking at the University of Illinois. Mathematics department papers show that the\nIllinois department chairman\u2019s recommended promotion met with initial resistance\nfrom the dean after which several senior members of her department wrote in her\nbehalf. She and her teaching were given high praise. It was noted that she had done\nmuch work with the teaching of teachers; also that she \u201chas talent for imparting\nenthusiasm for mathematics . . . whether it be elementary freshman mathemat-\nics, calculus for honors students, advanced calculus for engineers, or arithmetic for\nteachers.\u201d Other speci\ufb01c comments were: \u201cI believe that Professor Pepper\u2019s pro-\nmotion to an associate professorship is long overdue. . . . She succeeds in bringing\nthe spirit of mathematical creativity into whatever course the department assigns\nher to teach.\u201d \u201cOther members of our sta\ufb00 younger and of the opposite sex to that\nof Professor Pepper, have had immediate response to their requests for considera-\ntion.\u201d She was promoted to associate professor in 1960 and remained in that rank\nuntil she was forced to retire from the University of Illinois in 1965 because of her\nage, sixty-eight. She told her brother that she was not promoted to full professor\nbecause Olive Hazlett\u2019s illness had convinced the department that women were too\nfrail to become full professors.\n\nFrom 1965 to 1970, after her retirement from Illinois, Pepper was at Notre Dame\nUniversity in Nelson, British Columbia, as associate professor and department head.\nHer brother reported that she was asked to come to Notre Dame by a student she\nhad taught at Seattle College twenty years earlier. She was hired on a year-to-year\nbasis, and her appointment was not renewed the year she turned seventy-three.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nPEPPER - 3\n\nAccording to her brother, Echo Pepper was about \ufb01ve feet tall and weighed no\nmore than a hundred pounds. She was completely ambidextrous and could write\nwith both hands simultaneously. She was a paci\ufb01st and an Independent but more\nRepublican than Democrat. She was raised as a \u201chigh\u201d Episcopalian but became\na Roman Catholic when she was young. About 1940 she became an oblate of the\nOrder of St. Benedict, a lay position, having become involved with the Benedictines\nthrough St. Johns University in Collegeville, Minnesota. She was also a member of\nthe Catholic Daughters of America.\n\nAfter her second forced retirement, Pepper moved to the Washington, D.C., area\nto live in an adult community in Silver Spring, Maryland, near her brother. When\nshe was past eighty, she moved to the Retirement Living Center at Carroll Manor,\na Carmelite home. She died in the Carroll Manor Nursing Home in Hyattsville,\nMaryland, in January 1979 at age eighty-one after numerous strokes.

August 4, 1863\u2013September 27, 1954.\nSmith College (BA 1886, MA 1893), Yale University (PhD 1899).\n\nLeona May Peirce was born in Norway, Maine, which was also the birthplace of\nher mother, Mary Hobbs (Foster), born in 1839. Her father, Levi Merriam Peirce\n(also \u201cPierce\u201d), was born in West Boylston, Massachusetts, in 1833. He received\na bachelor\u2019s degree from Waterville College (now Colby College) in Maine in 1860\nand married two years later. He was a teacher for nearly a dozen years before\nstarting a music company specializing in the sale of pianos and organs in Spring\ufb01eld,\nMassachusetts; he was a music dealer for more than thirty years. Leona Peirce had\none sibling, William Foster Peirce (1868\u20131967), who was born in Chicopee Falls,\nMassachusetts, graduated from Amherst College in 1888, and served as president\nof Kenyon College in Ohio from 1896 until 1937.\n\nLeona Peirce attended Spring\ufb01eld High School and taught elementary subjects\nin a private school in Spring\ufb01eld for a year before entering Smith College in 1882.\nHer main subjects at Smith were rhetoric and history, with only the required math-\nematics courses. After her graduation from Smith in 1886, she taught mathematics,\nphysics, and chemistry at the Spring\ufb01eld Collegiate Institute for three years, 1886\u2013\n89. In the summer of 1887 she studied chemistry and French at Amherst College.\nDuring the following decade, Peirce was primarily engaged in study, with the\nfocus becoming mathematics. She enrolled at Cornell 1889\u201390 as a candidate for an\nadvanced degree studying mathematics, physics, and philosophy and took courses\nin mathematics and history of philosophy. She spent the following year, 1890\u201391,\nteaching mathematics at the Mount Hermon School for boys in Mt. Hermon, Mas-\nsachusetts, before returning to her studies. During 1891\u201392 she studied mathematics\nat Newnham College, Cambridge, and in 1892\u201393 she was at Smith College, where\nshe completed work for a master\u2019s degree in 1893. She returned to Cornell in 1893\nand again studied mathematics and philosophy. She was there for a year before\nleaving because of illness in her family.\n\nFollowing the suggestion of the Cornell mathematics department, Peirce arranged\nto study privately with William E. Story of Clark University, a school in Worcester,\nMassachusetts, that did not yet formally admit women to its doctoral programs.\nThis arrangement was made with the understanding that Peirce would return to\nCornell for her \ufb01nal examinations and present a thesis written under Story\u2019s direc-\ntion. After working with Story for three years, she submitted her thesis at Cornell\nin spring 1897 but did not receive a Cornell PhD owing to an apparently irresolv-\nable disagreement concerning the requirements for the \ufb01nal examination in one of\nher minor subjects. The examining committee believed that the originally stated\nrequirements for her minor in the theory of functions were not su\ufb03cient to demon-\nstrate competence in the subject and recommended her retaking the examination\nin three or four months after studying additional material. On the other hand,\nStory believed that she possessed the knowledge required for a PhD in mathemat-\nics and should not have been asked to satisfy additional requirements. Following\nStory\u2019s advice, Peirce did not retake the minor examination. Instead, she continued\nto work with him and then enrolled at Yale a year later. She received her PhD from\nYale in 1899 after having taken a year of course work. Her dissertation, most likely\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nPEIRCE - 2\n\nnearly the same as that deemed satisfactory by the Cornell examiners, was read and\napproved by Story and by Henry Seely White, then of Northwestern University.\n\nPeirce did not return to teaching mathematics for almost thirty years. During\nmost of the intervening years she was at her family home in Spring\ufb01eld. Upon the\ndeath of her father in 1908, she undertook the management, and was treasurer, of\nthe L. M. Pierce Co., her father\u2019s music company.\n\nPeirce was also involved in numerous civic and women\u2019s organizations. She served\nas trustee of the Wesson Memorial Hospital, as secretary of the Wesson Memorial\nHospital Visitors\u2019 Aid Association, and as a member of the Spring\ufb01eld school board.\nShe was an o\ufb03cer of many other organizations. She was recording secretary of the\nSpring\ufb01eld Women\u2019s Club, president of the Western Massachusetts Branch of the\nAssociation of Collegiate Alumnae, delegate to the biennial convention of the Gen-\neral Federation of Women\u2019s Clubs (1904 in St. Louis), president of the Spring\ufb01eld\nCollege Club, director of the Spring\ufb01eld Civil Service Reform League, and presi-\ndent of the Western Branch of the Smith College Alumnae Association. She was a\nmember of Kappa Alpha Theta, a social sorority; the Smith College Students\u2019 Aid\nAssociation; and the Congregational church.\n\nIn 1914 Peirce listed her hobbies as \u201cdriving and automobiling\u201d (WomWWA).\nShe also noted that she \u201cwas a contributor of articles to local newspapers on public\nmatters.\u201d That year she traveled for several months with her brother in Italy.\n\nIn 1928 Peirce began teaching mathematics and physics at the Barrington School\nfor Girls in Great Barrington, Massachusetts. During the summers of 1930 through\n1932 she studied mathematics at Harvard. She left the Barrington school in 1932\nand for the next two years taught mathematics and English at the Leominster,\nMassachusetts, high school.\n\nLeona Peirce had retired by 1937.

March 27, 1906\u2013November 23, 1966.\nUniversity of Pittsburgh (BA 1926, MA 1928, PhD 1935).\n\nMary Margaret Taylor was the only daughter and third of four children of Hallie\nBlanche Virginia (Criss) (1875\u20131959) and Albert Aaron Taylor (1872\u20131937), both\nof Washington County in the southwestern part of Pennsylvania, a few miles from\nPittsburgh. Her parents were married in 1899. Taylor\u2019s mother attended common\nschool and several terms at the state normal school and was a teacher in a one-room\nschool and a housewife; her father attended common school and was a carpenter,\nmason, cabinet maker, and general contractor, having engaged in home study in\naddition to common school. They had four children: Joseph Stewart (b. 1901),\nAlbert Alfred (b. 1902), Mary Margaret, and Edward A. (b. 1913), all born in\nMidway, Pennsylvania.\n\nMary Taylor grew up in Midway and attended the three-year high school there,\n1918\u201321. The following year she took the classical course in the Carnegie High\nSchool on the outskirts of Pittsburgh and graduated in 1922. She was awarded\nthe four-year college scholarship, given annually on the basis of a competitive ex-\namination, from Washington County. In her undergraduate years, 1922\u201326, at the\nUniversity of Pittsburgh she carried majors in both mathematics and Latin. She\nwas elected to Sigma Kappa Phi, a national foreign language honorary fraternity,\nand to QUAX, a women\u2019s science honorary society at Pittsburgh, before graduating\nwith highest honor, the only recipient of a BA so honored in 1926. A brother recalls\nthat she was o\ufb00ered graduate assistantships in both mathematics and Latin.\n\nTaylor held a graduate teaching assistantship at Pittsburgh from 1926 to 1930. In\nthis period she earned her master\u2019s degree in 1928, studied in the summer of 1928 at\nthe University of Chicago, and continued work toward the PhD at Pittsburgh. From\n1930 to 1934 Taylor was instructor of mathematics at the University of Pittsburgh\nat Johnstown, and in the academic year 1934\u201335 she was back at the Pittsburgh\ncampus as a graduate assistant to complete the work for her PhD.\n\nIn 1935 Taylor married Eugene R. Speer (1903\u20131978), a Pennsylvania native\nwho also graduated from the University of Pittsburgh in 1926, did graduate work\nthere in mathematics and physics 1926\u201328, and graduated from the University of\nPittsburgh law school. They remained in Pittsburgh, where she taught at her alma\nmater, and he practiced law. In 1936\u201337 she is listed in the university catalogue\nas Speer and as a graduate assistant. From 1937\u201338 to 1942\u201343 she is listed as an\ninstructor in mathematics.\n\nThe Speers had three children: Virginia Ellen (1941\u20131981), Eugene R., born in\n1943, and Susan Margaret, born in 1947. All three children did their undergraduate\nwork in mathematics. The elder daughter did a year of graduate work in mathemat-\nics in England as a Fulbright scholar and became a computer software manager. The\ntwo younger children earned PhD\u2019s in mathematics and computer science, respec-\ntively. Eugene Speer is in the department of mathematics at Rutgers University;\nSusan Speer Owicki was a faculty member in the department of electrical engineer-\ning at Stanford University, later earned an MA in counseling psychology, and is a\nlicensed marriage and family therapist.\n\nIn 1986 Mary Speer\u2019s son reported that she continued her position at the univer-\nsity until sometime after the birth of their elder daughter and before his birth, and\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSPEER - 2\n\nthat his mother \u201crecounted that she left the University of Pittsburgh, and mathe-\nmatics teaching, because men junior to her were promoted to Associate Professor\nwhile she was not, and because she was told that this was because the men had\nfamilies to support and needed the money\u201d (Smithsonian questionnaire).\n\nMary Speer was an involved Presbyterian throughout her life and was an active\nmember and administrator in Girl Scouts of Allegheny County, Pennsylvania, from\nthe early 1950s until her death.

Shea (1864\u20131933), a native of Kentucky.\nIn 1900 her parents, who at that time had been married four years, were living\nin St. Joseph with their two-year-old son. Also in the household were Elizabeth\u2019s\nmother and sister and Martin\u2019s sister. Martin Shea was a policeman. By 1910 all of\nthe family\u2019s children were born: Gertrude\u2019s brother Lawrence was three years older\nthan she; her brother Martin was two years younger; and her sister, Catherine, was\nseven years younger. Her father was a sergeant in the city police department.\n\nIn the 1920 census Gertrude Shea\u2019s occupation was listed as stenographer for\na railroad clearing house. She entered the Novitiate of the Sisters of Charity of\nLeavenworth in 1922, made \ufb01rst vows in 1924, and was thereafter known as Sister\nAnn Elizabeth Shea. She graduated from the newly named Saint Mary College, a\njunior college for women in Leavenworth, Kansas, in 1923, the \ufb01rst year instruction\nat the postsecondary level was added.

In 1930 she entered the University of Wisconsin to study for\nher master\u2019s degree. Department minutes of that period note that a master\u2019s thesis\nfor her was considered optional; in February of 1931 the department considered,\npresumably favorably, her request for approval of the following courses to complete\nher master\u2019s degree: real variables (one year), algebraic geometry (one year), and\nhigher algebra (\ufb01rst semester). She received the master\u2019s degree in 1931.\n\nFrom 1931 until her death in 1957, Sister Ann Elizabeth was associated with\nSaint Mary College.

May 17, 1860\u2013March 27, 1934.\nVassar College (BA 1881), Yale University (PhD 1895).\n\nCharlotte Cynthia Barnum was born in Phillipston, Massachusetts, the third of\nfour children of Charlotte (Betts) (1823\u20131899), of Connecticut, and Samuel Weed\nBarnum (1820\u20131891), born in New York. Two brothers of her mother received\nMD\u2019s from Yale in the 1840s. Samuel Weed Barnum received a BA in 1841 from\nYale and a BD in 1844 from the Yale Divinity School. Her parents married in 1849;\ntheir other children were Samuel Horace (b. 1852), Thomas Rossiter (1857\u20131938),\nand Clara Louisa (1866\u20131953). The two sons graduated from Yale in 1875 and\n1879, respectively, and the younger daughter graduated from Vassar in 1888 and\nattended the Yale graduate school 1892\u201394. Samuel Weed Barnum was pastor of\nCongregational churches in Connecticut and Massachusetts before moving to New\nHaven in 1865. He was engaged in various editorial projects, including the 1847\nrevision of Webster\u2019s Dictionary, Smith\u2019s Comprehensive Dictionary of the Bible\n(1868), and Webster\u2019s International Dictionary (1890).\n\nCharlotte Barnum attended Hillhouse High School in New Haven before enrolling\nat Vassar College in 1877 and graduating in 1881. Following her graduation she\ntaught at Betts Academy, a boys\u2019 preparatory school in Stamford, Connecticut,\n1881\u201382. She also taught at Hillhouse High School in 1883 and 1885\u201386. She did\ncomputing for the Yale Observatory 1883\u201385 and, also in 1885, computed angles of\ncrystals for a revision of James Dwight Dana\u2019s System of Mineralogy. She worked\nin 1886\u201390, and again in 1897, as editorial assistant on Webster\u2019s International\nDictionary. During the academic year 1889\u201390, Barnum was a teacher of astronomy\nat Smith College.\n\nIn 1890 Charlotte Barnum requested that she be allowed to take courses at the\nJohns Hopkins University. However, in 1890 Johns Hopkins did not o\ufb03cially admit\nwomen, even for graduate work, and was not to do so for another seventeen years.\nBarnum was supported in her request by Simon Newcomb, professor of mathemat-\nics and astronomy at Johns Hopkins, who wrote to President Daniel Coit Gilman\non November 6, 1890, making an argument for allowing quali\ufb01ed women to study\nmathematics and astronomy at the graduate level at the university. He added,\n\u201cThe immediate occasion of this communication is the residence in Baltimore of\nMiss Barnum, whom I believe you have seen, as a candidate for instruction. I would\nlike to submit a special request that Drs. [Thomas] Craig and [Fabian] Franklin be\nallowed to admit [Miss Barnum] to their post-graduate classes without committing\nthe university to any policy as to future cases of the same class. And, as a reason for\nthis course I may say that I know of no inconvenience that would thus arise\u201d (MS\n137, Johns Hopkins University Collection, Special Collections, Sheridan Libraries,\nThe Johns Hopkins University). In December the executive committee of the board\nof trustees voted that Barnum be allowed to attend Dr. Craig\u2019s lectures without en-\nrollment and without a charge for tuition. Consequently, she studied mathematical\nastronomy and physics at Johns Hopkins University 1890\u201392.\n\nWishing to earn a degree, however, Barnum entered Yale University in 1892, the\n\ufb01rst year women were o\ufb03cially admitted to the graduate school there. Her sister,\nClara, who had graduated from Vassar in 1888, also attended the Yale Graduate\nSchool in 1892\u201394; her studies were interrupted by illness. In late August 1893,\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBARNUM - 2\n\nCharlotte Barnum attended the International Mathematical Congress held in con-\nnection with the World\u2019s Columbian Exposition in Chicago. She was one of four\nwomen, of forty-\ufb01ve in total attendance. During her \ufb01rst two years at Yale, Char-\nlotte Barnum\u2019s course work was taken with Hubert A. Newton (Integral Calculus\nand Mechanics; Celestial Mechanics; Shooting Stars and Meteors); J. Willard Gibbs\n(Vector Analysis; Multiple Algebra); and Andrew W. Phillips (Analytic Geometry;\nSalmon\u2019s Conic Sections; Theory of Functions; Higher Plane Curves). In her last\nyear, she took courses in the Theory of Numbers with Irving Fisher, a young assis-\ntant professor, and in the Theory of Functions with James Pierpont, an 1894 Vienna\nPhD and \ufb01rst-year lecturer at Yale. It is unclear from the record who directed her\ndissertation. She received her PhD in 1895.\n\nIn 1895\u201396 Barnum was an instructor of mathematics at Carleton College in\nNorth\ufb01eld, Minnesota. After this one year of college teaching, she spent most of\nthe remainder of her career working in applied areas of mathematics and in editorial\nwork. Many of the following details are reported in the Yale Obituary Record. She\njoined the American Institute of Actuaries in 1898 and worked as an actuarial\ncomputer for the Massachusetts Mutual Life Insurance Company, Spring\ufb01eld, in\n1898 and for the Fidelity Mutual Life Insurance Company, Philadelphia, 1900\u201301.\nThe AMS membership lists during this period do not indicate any employers, but\ndo list Barnum\u2019s address in New Haven in January 1898 and 1899, in Stamford,\nConnecticut, in January 1900, and in Philadelphia in January 1901. From 1901 to\n1913 she was in Washington, D.C.: as a computer for the US Naval Observatory\nin 1901 and for the tidal division of the US Coast and Geodetic Survey 1901\u2013\n08, and as editorial assistant in the biological survey for the US Department of\nAgriculture 1908\u201313, where she \u201cwrote articles on tides, currents, annuities, and\nsocial legislation\u201d (Williams Papers). An article she wrote suggesting a limit on\nthe amount of money working women should spend on clothing appeared in the\njournal of the Women\u2019s Trade Union League in 1911. She also did editorial work\non books by the Carnegie Institution of Washington. Although Barnum was at the\nUS Naval Observatory for less than a year, she is one of twelve women pro\ufb01led in\n\u201cThe Contributions of Women to the United States Naval Observatory: The Early\nYears.\u201d\n\nBarnum indicated in her last entry in American Men of Science that from 1914\nto 1926 she was an editor and proofreader of scienti\ufb01c works. From 1914 until 1918\nshe was, for the most part, in New Haven and engaged mainly in editorial work: for\nthe Yale Peruvian Expeditions 1914\u201315, for the Yale University secretary\u2019s o\ufb03ce\n1915\u201316, and for the Yale University Press in 1915 and 1918\u201319. AMS membership\nlists indicate the following. From January 1914 through January 1916 her address\nis in New Haven, but the January 1917 AMS membership list puts her in New\nYork City as a consulting actuary; her address remains in New York City through\nDecember 1922, although no positions are listed. In October 1926 she is again\nusing a New Haven address. In a letter of January 14, 1920, she wrote that she had\n\u201cworked for a year here in New York on the Chronicles of America, published by\nthe Press\u201d and that she had just \ufb01nished editing a book on labor unrest (Charlotte\nC. Barnum to Miss Margaret Corwin, Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, Yale\nUniversity, Student Records (RU 262), Manuscripts and Archives, Yale University\nLibrary). She taught in 1922 in the Scoville and the Columbia preparatory schools\nin New York and in 1923 in the Walnut Hill School in Natick, Massachusetts.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBARNUM - 3\n\nBarnum was one of the early members of the AMS, having been admitted in\nOctober 1894, about three years after the \ufb01rst women joined the society.

It\nwas read and approved by Aubrey E. Landry, soon to retire, and J. Nelson Rice.\n\nVarnhorn returned to the College of Notre Dame of Maryland as instructor for the year\n1939\u201340. She then joined the faculty at Trinity College in Washington, D.C., in 1940, six\nyears after the death of Sister Marie Cecilia Mangold, who had directed the department\nfor most of its previous history. When Varnhorn arrived at Trinity College (now called\nTrinity Washington University), she joined Sister Thomas Marie (Catherine Maloney),\nan associate professor who was studying for a PhD at Catholic, and Sister Mary Robert\n(Grand\ufb01eld), who had joined the faculty the year Sister Marie Cecilia died. Sister Mary\nRobert left in 1941, and Sister Thomas Marie died rather suddenly in the fall of 1943,\nleaving the twenty-nine-year-old Mary Varnhorn alone in the department. At \ufb01rst, some\ncourses were taught by Otto Ramler, professor at Catholic University, and then by various\nothers who \ufb01lled in.\n\nVarnhorn remained at Trinity for the rest of her career. She was instructor 1940\u201344,\nassistant professor 1944\u201345, associate professor 1945\u201358, and professor 1958\u201378. From 1945\nuntil her retirement, she was chairman of the department, which usually consisted of at\nmost three people. She initiated a number of curricular changes in the early 1960s and\nwas recognized especially for her commitment to teaching when she received, in 1965, the\nPro Ecclesia et Ponti\ufb01ce Medal for twenty-\ufb01ve years of service at Trinity College.\n\nVarnhorn maintained her residence in Baltimore throughout her life and commuted\ninto Washington. After her formal retirement in 1978 she taught two courses at Trinity\nCollege as an adjunct in the fall of 1978\u201379, and she taught brie\ufb02y at Loyola College in\nBaltimore and at the University of Baltimore. She was a member of the Duodecimal Society\nof America (Dozenal Society of America since 1980), an organization for the conduct of\nresearch and education in the use of the base twelve number system. Varnhorn was a\nDemocrat and a Roman Catholic. She was at one time president of the Mother Seton\nMission Crusade Unit, a group devoted to helping the needy.\n\nMary Varnhorn died at age seventy-four of a respiratory ailment at St. Agnes Hospital\nin Baltimore in 1988.

      "text": "CRATHORNE, Charlotte Elvira (Pengra). May 30, 1875\u2013February 9, 1916.\nUniversity of Wisconsin (BA 1897, PhD 1901).\n\nCharlotte Elvira Pengra was born in Juda, Wisconsin, the eldest of \ufb01ve children\nof Mary Ellen (Preston) (b. 1853) and Win\ufb01eld Sherman Pengra (b. 1847), both\nnatives of Wisconsin. In 1880 the family was living in Je\ufb00erson, Wisconsin, near\nMadison, and her father was a farmer; in 1900 they lived in Madison and he was a\nlandlord. All of the \ufb01ve Pengra children received bachelor\u2019s degrees from the Uni-\nversity of Wisconsin; in addition to Charlotte, they were Mabel (b. 1877), Preston\n(b. 1880), Delia (b. 1882), and Marshall (b. 1885), and they earned their degrees in\n1899, 1902, 1904, and 1905, respectively.\n\nCharlotte Pengra graduated from the Madison, Wisconsin, high school before\nattending the University of Wisconsin, from which she received her BA in 1897, the\nsame year that Wisconsin awarded its \ufb01rst PhD in mathematics. She then taught\nin high schools in Fox Lake and Sparta, both in Wisconsin. In a letter to Charles S.\nSlichter, inquiring about a possible fellowship for graduate study at the University\nof Wisconsin, written May 12, 1899, from Sparta, Pengra indicated that she wanted\na more complete college education for its own sake and because she would like to\nteach mathematics to students more advanced than in the high school. She indicated\nthat she wanted to take a PhD, probably from Wisconsin, and that if she had the\nfellowship she would not teach again until she received the degree. Whereas the\n\ufb01nancial question was \u201cnot very pressing,\u201d she wrote that if she did not get the\nfellowship she would stay in Sparta (Biographical Files, Charles S. Slichter, Box\n35, Miscellaneous University Correspondence 1886\u20131946, University of Wisconsin-\nMadison Archives). She did receive it and completed her work for the PhD with\nL. W. Dowling two years later, as the third Wisconsin PhD in mathematics. After\nreceiving her doctorate, Pengra was in charge of the mathematics department of a\nhigh school in Elgin, Illinois, for three years.\n\nOn June 21, 1904, in Madison, Charlotte Pengra married the English-born\nArthur Robert Crathorne (1873\u20131946), who had been a graduate student and in-\nstructor in mathematics at Wisconsin. He had come to the United States with his\nfamily as a young boy, grew up in Illinois, received a bachelor\u2019s degree from the\nUniversity of Illinois in 1898, was a tutor in mathematics and astronomy at the\nUniversity of Maine, and had been at Wisconsin since 1900. Shortly after the wed-\nding they sailed from Montreal to Liverpool to spend some time in England before\ncontinuing to Germany.\n\nThe Crathornes spent the years 1904 through 1907 studying mathematics at\nG\u00a8ottingen, where A. R. Crathorne received his PhD in 1907. Their daughter Mary\nPreston was born on November 28, 1906. On their return from G\u00a8ottingen, A. R.\nCrathorne took a position at the University of Illinois. The Crathornes had two\nmore children: Anne Harrison, born July 31, 1909, and Arthur Robert Jr., born\nJune 5, 1911.\n\nCharlotte Crathorne\u2019s daughters report that she was a collaborator in the prepa-\nration of College Algebra by H. L. Rietz and A. R. Crathorne in 1909, although she\nis not mentioned in the extensive acknowledgements in the preface to the book.\n\nAfter an illness of about three years, Charlotte Crathorne died of breast cancer\nat her parents\u2019 home in Brodhead, Wisconsin, in 1916 at age forty.

      "text": "McCOY, Dorothy. August 9, 1903\u2013November 21, 2001.\nBaylor University (BA 1925), University of Iowa (MS 1927, PhD 1929).\n\nDorothy McCoy was born in Waukomis in Oklahoma Territory, four years before\nOklahoma attained statehood. She was the elder of two children of Susan Ellen\n(Holmes) (1876\u20131941) and Stephen Franklin McCoy (1860\u20131906). Her mother was\nborn in Kansas but grew up in Lawrence County in southwestern Missouri and\nattended a few short terms at a country school. Her father, born in Alabama, was a\nfarmer who homesteaded in Oklahoma. He had almost no education but did learn\nto read and write. Her parents were married in 1902. Her younger brother, Neal\nHenry, was born on March 6, 1905.\n\nAfter Dorothy McCoy\u2019s father died in 1906, her mother and the two young\nchildren moved to Chesapeake in Lawrence County, Missouri, where her mother\nstill had family. There Dorothy and Neal attended a one-room elementary school\nbefore the family moved to nearby Marionville where the children attended high\nschool. After Neal skipped the seventh grade, the two of them did almost all of their\nfurther schooling together. Dorothy McCoy wrote in 1985 that her mother was very\nambitious for both her children.\n\nAfter Dorothy and Neal McCoy graduated from high school in 1921, the family\nmoved to Waco, Texas, where they both attended Baylor University, a Baptist\nschool. After they graduated from Baylor with honors in 1925, both taught in\nhigh school for a year in Texas; Dorothy was in Port Arthur. Together they then\nbegan their graduate work at the State University of Iowa, the o\ufb03cial name of the\nUniversity of Iowa, in Iowa City in July 1926. They earned their master\u2019s degrees\na year later and continued with their work for the doctorate. Dorothy McCoy\u2019s\nmajor \ufb01eld of study was mathematics with a \ufb01rst minor in education and a second\nminor in psychology. She wrote her dissertation in topology under the direction of\nE. W. Chittenden; Neal\u2019s dissertation was on commutation formulas in the algebra\nof quantum mechanics and was also directed by Chittenden. Both Dorothy and\nNeal received their doctorates in 1929. While at Iowa Dorothy held a scholarship\nfor one year, a fellowship for the year 1927\u201328, and a graduate assistantship during\n1928\u201329, her last year there. Dorothy McCoy was the only woman to receive a\ndoctorate in mathematics at Iowa before 1940.\n\nNeal McCoy held a National Research fellowship at Princeton for the two years\nafter receiving his PhD and then joined the faculty at Smith College, where he had\na distinguished career as a researcher and teacher. He was particularly noted as the\nauthor of textbooks in abstract algebra. He retired in 1970.\n\nImmediately after receiving her PhD, Dorothy McCoy went to Belhaven College\nin Jackson, Mississippi, as professor and head of the mathematics department.\nDuring her twenty-year tenure there, Belhaven was a women\u2019s college a\ufb03liated with\nthe Presbyterian church. While there, she sponsored the Baptist Student Union. In\nthe summer of 1930 she taught as a visitor at Baylor, while during the summer\nquarter of 1931, she attended classes at the University of Chicago as a visiting\nPhD. According to her obituary she also studied during a summer at Columbia\nUniversity. In 1933 she joined the editorial board of the Mathematics News Letter,\nthen an independent journal that had been published under the auspices of the\nLouisiana-Mississippi Section of the MAA and the Louisiana-Mississippi Branch of\nthe NCTM until the end of 1931. In 1934 the journal changed its name to National\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMcCOY - 2\n\nMathematics Magazine, and McCoy remained on the board until its last issue under\nthat name in 1945; in 1947 it resumed publication as Mathematics Magazine. Also\nduring this time McCoy was active in the Louisiana-Mississippi Section of the MAA.\nShe served as secretary of the section 1932\u201337, chairman 1937\u201338, and vice chairman\nfor Mississippi 1938\u201339.\n\nThe attraction of teaching in a Baptist college contributed to McCoy\u2019s decision\nto move to Wayland Baptist College (now University) in Plainview, Texas, in 1949,\ntwo years after it became a four-year college. She went as professor of mathematics\nand chairman of the division of physical and biological sciences. During the aca-\ndemic year 1953\u201354, she was a Fulbright professor at Baghdad University in Iraq.\nShe also attended institutes for college teachers in Boulder, Colorado, during the\nsummer of 1953; at Vanderbilt University for one summer and a semester; and\nat Washington State University. Between 1954 and 1958 she worked one summer\nat Patrick Air Force Base in Florida and two summers at the Aberdeen Proving\nGround in Maryland. She also taught one summer at Northwestern State Teacher\u2019s\nCollege (now Northwestern Oklahoma State University) in Alva, Oklahoma. She\nwas visiting professor at the University of Hawaii in summer 1958 and at Baylor\nin summer 1961. Her obituary indicates that she also taught for a summer at the\nUniversity of New Mexico. She served on the council of the AAUP in the early\n1960s. She remained chairman of the division of physical and biological sciences at\nWayland Baptist until 1972.\n\nIn 1975 McCoy retired as distinguished professor emeritus of mathematics. After\nher retirement she spent six months as a teacher of children of missionaries in\nMalawi in southeastern Africa; a year later she worked for three months at a similar\nschool in Indonesia. These experiences caused her to found a mission interest group\nin Plainview; she remained involved with that group for the remainder of her life.\nThe Dorothy McCoy lecture series was established in 1980, she received the\nWayland Alumni Association plaque for distinguished service to students in 1982,\nand she was given the Roy McClung Service plaque for her concern for foreign\nstudents at Wayland Baptist. In 1999 she was the \ufb01rst to receive the Distinguished\nLifetime Service Award from the Association of Former Students. A bust, created\nby a former art teacher at Wayland, has been on display at the library. In September\n2001 she was one of the \ufb01rst two inductees into the Division of Mathematics and\nScience hall of honor at Wayland Baptist.\n\nDorothy McCoy was a Southern Baptist and was active in the First Baptist\nChurch in Plainview. She had many hobbies over the years, including travel, pho-\ntography, and in later years, bird watching. According to her obituary, her travels\nincluded Central America, South America, and India, in addition to her trips to\nIraq and Africa. She maintained her home in Plainview, but continued to visit her\nbrother, Neal, in Massachusetts until both were well into their nineties. Neal Mc-\nCoy died in Northampton on January 4, 2001. According to a communication from\nJanet Seright, a friend in Plainview, Dorothy McCoy remained active, drove her\ncar, and was still involved in church and mission activities until September of that\nyear.\n\nOn September 27, 2001, Wayland Baptist dedicated in Dorothy McCoy\u2019s name\na recently acquired and renovated property to serve as a senior men\u2019s honors dor-\nmitory. The day after the dedication she moved from her home to Prairie House\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMcCOY - 3\n\nLiving Center, an assisted living facility in Plainview, where she died at age ninety-\neight less than two months later.

      "text": "McCAIN, Gertrude I. July 15, 1879\u2013April 4, 1955.\nIndiana University (BA 1908, MA 1911, PhD 1918).\n\nGertrude Iona McCain was the daughter of Alice A. (Ne\ufb00) (b. 1855) and Charles\nEdwin McCain (b. 1854), natives of Indiana who married in Carroll County, Indiana,\non December 28, 1876. In 1880 her parents, her two-year-old brother, Christian, and\nshe were living with her maternal grandparents in Three Rivers, Michigan, where\nshe was born. At that time, her father was a grocer. By 1900 her family was living\nin Delphi, Indiana, and her father was a manufacturer of lime. In 1910 he was\ndescribed as a foreman in the lime business; in 1920 her widowed father was baili\ufb00\nat the county court.\n\nMcCain graduated from the Delphi high school in 1896, at sixteen. During the\nnext four years she attended Indiana State Normal School for a year and a half and\nwas a teacher in the high school in Delphi from 1897 to 1899. During most of the\nfollowing decade, she worked, some as a librarian, and did her undergraduate work\nat Indiana University.\n\nIn the fall quarter of 1900, McCain entered Indiana and remained through the\nspring term 1902. She then interrupted her studies for \ufb01ve years, some of this time\nas librarian for the Delphi Public Library. In June 1905 she inquired about a place\nas assistant in the Indiana University library. She wrote to Dr. Robert J. Aley, a\nmember of the mathematics department at Indiana, on June 19, 1905, \u201cI would\ntake the barest living expenses for a salary, if I had time to take some college\nwork. I would like to go on with Mathematics if I have not forgotten too much.\nI have been in library work two years and expect to attend the school held by\nthe the State Library Commission this summer at Winona\u201d (Indiana University\nArchives). Apparently McCain did not get the position for she remained at the\nlibrary in Delphi through the summer of 1907. She was \ufb01nally able to return to\nIndiana for the academic year 1907\u201308 and graduated in 1908 shortly before she\nturned twenty-nine.\n\nDuring the next ten years, McCain taught and did graduate work in mathe-\nmatics. She was principal of the Friends\u2019 High School, a Quaker school in Salem,\nIndiana, 1908\u201309 and began her graduate studies at Indiana in summer 1909. She\ncontinued in the fall term 1909\u201310 and, after a break, resumed her graduate work\nin summer 1910. She was a teaching fellow during the academic year 1910\u201311 and\nearned one of four master\u2019s degrees in mathematics granted by Indiana in 1911.\nThe following year, 1911\u201312, McCain was a fellow in mathematics at Bryn Mawr\nCollege, where it is recorded that she gave a talk on discontinuous groups at the\nBryn Mawr Mathematical Journal Club. In February 1912 McCain asked for a\nrecommendation from Indiana to support an application for a position at Wilson\nCollege, which she apparently did not get.\n\nIn at least 1912 McCain was again teaching at the high school in Delphi, giving\ninstruction in both mathematics and English, although she was also doing graduate\nwork at Indiana University in the winter and spring terms of 1913\u201314. She continued\nwith a fellowship at Indiana the academic year 1914\u201315. She was also president\nof the Graduate Club in 1914. In 1915 McCain took a position as professor of\nmathematics at Oxford College for Women (later merged with Miami University)\nin Oxford, Ohio, where she remained for six years. During this period, in 1918, at\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMcCAIN - 2\n\nnearly thirty-nine, she completed the work for her PhD at Indiana with a minor in\nphilosophy, which at that time included psychology.\n\nMcCain left Oxford College in 1921, taught at Hunter College in New York City\nthat summer, and in September 1921 became professor at Westminster College in\nNew Wilmington, Pennsylvania, where she remained until June 1928. She started\nteaching at the State Teachers College (now Radford University) in East Radford,\nVirginia, in the summer quarter 1929 and remained as professor until the end of the\nacademic year 1930\u201331. In June 1931 she requested that a transcript of her work\nat Indiana be sent to the Department of Education in Sacramento, California. She\nwrote that she hoped to get located in California that year. She was applying for\na general secondary credential but had insu\ufb03cient hours in courses designated as\neducation courses and so was not eligible to apply.\n\nIn 1931\u201332 McCain taught mathematics as a professor at Marymount College in\nSalina, Kansas, before Sister Mary Nicholas Arnoldy assumed the position there. In\nSeptember 1933 McCain was still trying to get secondary credentials in California\nand asked that the many courses in philosophy (which included psychology) that she\nhad taken at Indiana be itemized, which they were. Again she was unsuccessful.\nAccording to MAA membership lists, she was living in her hometown of Delphi\nin 1933\u201334 and in East Radford, Virginia, in 1935\u201336, in both cases without a\nprofessional a\ufb03liation. She was professor of mathematics and physics at Brenau\nCollege, a private women\u2019s college in Gainsville, Georgia, in the academic year\n1937\u201338. While there she also served as the head of the house for a sorority on\ncampus. There is no indication of any professional activity after this time although\nshe sought a position at Athens College in Alabama in 1940 when she was sixty,\npresumably when she learned of the retirement of Kathryn Wyant because of illness.\nFrom December 1915, when McCain attended the organizational meeting of the\nMAA at Ohio State University, until the late 1930s, she maintained her a\ufb03liation\nwith the MAA and submitted problem solutions to the Monthly over a period of\nabout twenty years. She also joined the AMS in 1915 but appears to have dropped\nher membership about the time she left State College in Radford.\n\nAt some point McCain returned to Delphi, Indiana, where she was a member of\nthe Presbyterian Church. She was also a \ufb01fty-year member of the Rose Chapter of\nthe Order of the Eastern Star.\n\nGertrude McCain su\ufb00ered from cardio-vascular-renal disease and generalized\narthritis for several years before her death in 1955 at age seventy-\ufb01ve in the Deer\nCreek nursing home near Delphi in Carroll County, Indiana.

      "text": "HENNEL, Cora B. January 21, 1886\u2013June 26, 1947.\nIndiana University (BA 1907, MA 1908, PhD 1912).\n\nCora Barbara Hennel was born in Evansville, Indiana, the second of three daugh-\nters of Anna M. (Thuman) (1854\u20131925), born in Indiana, and Joseph Hennel (1842\u2013\n1934), born in Ohio. Her parents married in 1882; it was a second marriage for her\nfather. In early years he was a teacher, served for three years on the Union side\nin the Civil War, and later was in business. In 1900 three children (of \ufb01ve born)\nwere living: Cecilia Barbara, born in 1883; Cora Barbara, born in 1886; and Edith\nAmelia, born in 1891. They lived on a farm near Evansville.\n\nCora Hennel and her older sister went to grade school together and both grad-\nuated from Evansville (now Central) High School in 1901. They then taught in\ncountry grade schools to save money for college and entered Indiana University in\nBloomington together in the fall of 1903. The following year they convinced their\nparents and sister to move to Bloomington.\n\nAll three daughters received bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from Indiana; Cora\nand Cecilia received BA\u2019s in 1907 and MA\u2019s in 1908 (Cora in mathematics and\nCecilia in English), and Edith received a BA in 1911 and an MA in 1912 (both in\nbotany) and stayed an additional year as a teaching fellow. Cora was a member of\nMortar Board; all three were elected to Phi Beta Kappa. Both of Hennel\u2019s sisters\nwere on the faculty at Indiana before their marriages; her older sister, Cecilia Hennel\nHendricks, returned to the English department in 1931 after homesteading with her\nhusband in Wyoming. She remained on the faculty until her retirement in 1953.\n\nCora Hennel continued her studies and began teaching at Indiana University\nimmediately after receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree. She was a teaching fellow 1907\u2013\n09, earned her master\u2019s degree in 1908, and was appointed instructor of mathematics\nin August 1909. At the suggestion of Professor David Rothrock, she continued her\nwork toward the doctorate, and wrote her dissertation during the year 1911\u201312\nunder the direction of R. D. Carmichael. Carmichael received his PhD at Princeton\nas a student of G. D. Birkho\ufb00 in 1911 and was at Indiana brie\ufb02y before he moved to\nthe University of Illinois in 1915. Hennel\u2019s diaries in the Indiana University Archives\ndescribe her time as a student. Her entry of January 22, 1912, records, \u201cNow as\nfor this term . . . the most remarkable thing is that I\u2019m not teaching at all \u2013 just\nstudying.\u201d On April 14 she wrote, \u201cI\u2019m simply cutting out everything this term\nand working . . . thesis coming all right, but when I think of the cramming I\u2019ll have\nto do between now & June I feel desperate. Dr. C. has been very encouraging tho:\nhe told me the other day my knowledge of math is as broad as that of half the men\nin the math faculty at Princeton. Gracious!\u201d On June 9, after her examination, she\nwrote, \u201cWell, it\u2019s over. And Dr. Carmichael said I passed a \u2018brilliant examination.\u2019 \u201d\nHennel\u2019s PhD in June 1912 was the \ufb01rst in mathematics and the \ufb01rst to a woman\nawarded by Indiana University. It was only the second doctorate in mathematics\ngranted in the state of Indiana, the \ufb01rst having been awarded by Purdue to James\nByrnie Shaw in 1897.\n\nHennel continued to hold a faculty position at Indiana until her death. She re-\nmained an instructor until 1916, was assistant professor 1916\u201323, associate professor\n1923\u201336, and became professor in 1936. In about 1907 Hennel was instrumental in\nhelping to start the Euclidean Circle, a mathematics club for mathematics majors,\nupperclassmen, graduate students, and faculty in the department. An article on\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHENNEL - 2\n\nthe Euclidean Circle in the winter 2006\u201307 department alumni newsletter notes the\ntopics of some presentations Hennel made to the club. In 1925 she and a colleague,\nHarold T. Davis, produced notes that were used in a general mathematics course.\nThe notes were not published, but were bound and distributed by the bookstore.\n\nHennel was extremely active on the campus, serving, for example, as president\nof the Indiana University chapters of AAUP, AAUW, the YWCA Board, the Corda\nFratres Association of Cosmopolitan Clubs (dedicated to fostering understanding\nbetween foreign and American students), and the Women\u2019s Faculty Club. She was\nforeign student advisor, and, in 1920, was chairman of a committee on friendly\nrelations among foreign students. She chaperoned student events, was a member\nof the university\u2019s student a\ufb00airs committee, and was on the advisory board of\nthe Association of Women Students. She regularly participated in local, state, and\nnational meetings of mathematical and scienti\ufb01c organizations. She attended the\norganizational meeting of the MAA at Ohio State University in December 1915 and\nwas vice chairman 1939\u201340 and chairman 1940\u201341 of the Indiana Section. She was\nalso chairman of the mathematics division of the Indiana Academy of Science for\n1940, and she and her sister attended the Harvard Tercentenary Conference of Arts\nand Sciences in Cambridge, Massachusetts in 1936.\n\nThe obituary in the Proceedings of the Indiana Academy of Science records that\nHennel was \u201cwell known throughout the State, having addressed numerous Indiana\nUniversity alumni groups, and various educational, professional and civic organi-\nzations\u201d (p. 4). It notes further that \u201cDr. Hennel\u2019s chief contributions were in her\nexcellent teaching and her in\ufb02uence on many students, both native and foreign. . . .\nIn her quiet and unobtrusive way she encouraged and helped many of them not\nonly through counseling but \ufb01nancially as well\u201d (p. 4). In 1995 the Indiana math-\nematics department named its faculty/student lounge the Cora B. Hennel Room;\nthe department also annually awards Cora B. Hennel memorial scholarships to out-\nstanding undergraduate majors.\n\nHennel\u2019s main hobby was writing poetry, and some of her poems appeared in\nvarious publications including The Columbia Anthology of Verse and School and\nSociety. She was a\ufb03liated with the First Methodist Church in Bloomington.\n\nCora Hennel had undergone major surgery several weeks before her death in\nBloomington in 1947 at age sixty-one of colon cancer. She was survived by her two\nsisters, four nieces, and a nephew.

November 24, 1900\u2013March 1, 1998.\nEmmanuel College (BA 1926), Boston College (MA 1928), Catholic University\nof America (PhD 1931).\n\nEthel Louise Burke was born in Boston, Massachusetts, the daughter of Caroline\nDorcas (Leonard) (1860\u20131934) and James Henry Burke (1857\u2013ca. 1904). Her parents\nwere born in Boston and were educated in the Boston public school system. They\nwere married in about 1883 and probably had \ufb01ve children survive to adulthood\nof eight born. Of these Ethel was the youngest. Her siblings were sisters, Annie (b.\n1890) and Carrie (b. 1893), and brothers, William (b. 1895) and Thomas (b. 1897).\nHer mother was a housewife, and her father was chief telegrapher for Western Union\nin Boston before his death in his late forties.\n\nEthel Burke\u2019s primary and secondary education was obtained in Boston public\nschools. After her high school graduation in 1918, she attended the Boston Normal\nSchool for three years, 1918\u201321, to obtain her certi\ufb01cation to teach in the Boston\nschool system. Each summer for six years after her high school graduation she\nworked as playground instructor for the Boston public schools; the two years after\nshe received her certi\ufb01cation she taught in public elementary school in Boston.\n\nIn 1923 Burke entered the Congregation of Sisters of Saint Joseph in Boston.\nA year later Sister Mary Leonarda Burke began a seven-year period of studying\nfor her undergraduate and graduate degrees. Her two years, 1924\u201326, at Emmanuel\nCollege, founded in 1919 as New England\u2019s \ufb01rst Catholic college for women, resulted\nin her bachelor\u2019s degree as a mathematics major in 1926. Sister Leonarda earned\nher master\u2019s degree from Boston College by studying part time while also teaching\nmathematics, French, and history at the secondary level in the Boston diocesan\nschools. In the \ufb01rst year of her master\u2019s work she took courses on weekends; during\nthe second year she took courses after classes \ufb01nished at her school. Her 1928 thesis\nhad as its topic calculus in high school mathematics.\n\nFrom 1928 to 1931, Sister Leonarda was in residence at the Catholic University\nof America, where she studied mathematics, education, and physics. She was among\na group of \ufb01ve students, four women religious (Burke, Sr. Mary de Lellis Gough, Sr.\nCharles Mary Morrison, and Sr. Mary Felice Vaudreuil) and one lay man (James\nNorman Eastham), who earned their PhD\u2019s in 1931 under the direction of Aubrey\nE. Landry. All \ufb01ve wrote dissertations describing and counting the di\ufb00erent types of\npolygons in-and-circumscribed to a rational quartic curve with variously speci\ufb01ed\nsingularities and symmetries.\n\nIn the fall of 1931 she began her long association with Regis College, a Catholic\ncollege for women in Weston, near Boston, founded by her order and opened just\nfour years earlier. In 1981 Sister Leonarda recalled, \u201cThe foresight and aspirations\nof the foundress of Regis College, Mother Mary Domitilla, C.S.J., motivated and\nenhanced my involvement in mathematics when she was aspiring to have a strong\nfaculty in the early years, and her e\ufb00orts provided the departments Latin, History,\nGreek, French, Mathematics, Biology, Chemistry, etc. in that order\u201d (Smithsonian\nquestionnaire).\n\nSister Leonarda served at Regis College in a variety of capacities: as teacher,\nadministrator, and as researcher. From 1931 to 1964, as professor of mathematics\nand chairman of the department, she taught a full complex of courses including\nwork in analysis (calculus, advanced calculus, and numerical analysis); statistics\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBURKE - 2\n\n(descriptive and mathematical); modern algebra and projective geometry (o\ufb00ered\nas electives during the late 1940s and early 1950s); junior and senior seminars;\nand computer programming. She engaged in post-doctoral research at Catholic\nUniversity in the summer of 1940. She also studied modern mathematical techniques\nin teaching at the University of Chicago in the summer of 1950. From 1963 to 1965\nshe served as director of the computer center at Regis.\n\nFor twenty-\ufb01ve years, 1953\u201378, Sister Leonarda was director of the Regis College\nResearch Center and principal investigator for contractual work for the Air Force\nResearch Center, Hanscom Field. Her work involved mathematical analysis primar-\nily associated with climatology, meteorology, ionospheric studies, and interplanetary\nstudies. After 1978 she held the title Research Analyst, Institutional Research, at\nRegis. She also held the rank professor emeritus after her retirement from teaching\nin 1964.\n\nSister Leonarda Burke received the Outstanding Educator Award from Regis\nCollege in 1975. She was given a special achievement award in acknowledgment\nof twenty-\ufb01ve years service in support of the research mission of the Geophysics\nLaboratory of the Air Force on November 15, 1978.\n\nFor more than thirty years, Sister Leonarda was a member of the Association\nof Teachers of Mathematics in New England. From 1958 she made tape recordings\nfor the blind of books from a variety of \ufb01elds for the Communication Center, Mas-\nsachusetts Association for the Blind. One project, for example, involved recording\nthe six volumes of Andrew R. Forsyth\u2019s Theory of Di\ufb00erential Equations.\n\nSister Leonarda Burke died at age ninety-seven at the Bethany Health Care Cen-\nter in Framingham, Massachusetts, in 1998.

November 22, 1889\u2013September 13, 1974.\nUniversity of Kansas (BA 1913, MA 1921, PhD 1926).\n\nFlorence Lucile Black was born in Meade County, Kansas, the fourth of \ufb01ve\nchildren of Mary Ella (Winslow) (b. 1852) and Moses Black (b. 1845), both natives\nof Illinois. Moses Black was a land surveyor and rancher. The children were Zada\n(b. 1878), Ernest (1882\u20131949), and Ethel (b. 1884), all born in Illinois, and Florence\nand Frances (b. 1891), born in Kansas. Her brother, Ernest Bateman Black, became\na well-known consulting engineer in Kansas City who in 1942 was president of the\nAmerican Society of Civil Engineers.\n\nFlorence Black grew up on a cattle ranch in southwestern Kansas. She described\nher earliest years in \u201cLife on the Cattle Range in the Early Days of Western\nKansas, or Moses Moves to Kansas,\u201d which is included in G. Baley Price\u2019s his-\ntory of the Kansas mathematics department (Appendix VII, 736\u201345). When she\nwas very young she lived in a large one-room sod house. Her earliest school con-\nsisted of her father or sister Zada as teacher, and four students: the two youngest\nBlack girls and two neighbor children, all four of whom later graduated from the\nUniversity of Kansas.\n\nBlack attended the University of Kansas in Lawrence and graduated in 1913.\nAfter her graduation, she taught for two years at the high school in Anthony,\nKansas, and for three years at a high school in Wichita. In 1918 she returned to\nthe university as instructor in mathematics and remained on the faculty until her\nretirement. Initially she also took graduate courses and received her master\u2019s degree\nin 1921 and her PhD with a minor in physics in 1926, the same year that Wealthy\nBabcock earned her doctorate at Kansas.\n\nHaving earned her PhD, Black was promoted to assistant professor in 1926. As\nwas the case with her colleague and friend Wealthy Babcock, she was promoted to\nassociate professor in 1940. She retired as associate professor emeritus in 1960.\n\nPrice notes in his department history that \u201cmany will remember Professor Black\nbest as an outstanding teacher. . . \u201d (p. 747). Upon her retirement the Florence Black\nExcellence in Teaching Award was established to provide a gift to the best teacher\namong the mathematics department\u2019s \ufb01rst-year assistant instructors. The university\nalso awards a Florence Black scholarship, and, in its 2005 annual report, the College\nof Liberal Arts and Sciences announced the establishment of the Florence Black\nand Wealthy Babcock Professorship in Mathematics. Black\u2019s other contributions\nto the University of Kansas included her serving as a member of the university\u2019s\ncommittee on scholarships for twenty years, as secretary of the college faculty for\nnineteen years, as faculty advisor of the women\u2019s pep club from its founding until\n1952, and as treasurer of the Women\u2019s Faculty Club and of the University of Kansas\nchapter of Sigma Xi. She was also a faithful attendee at meetings of the Kansas\nSection of the MAA.\n\nA paper read by Price at her memorial service noted her many extracurricular\ninterests: horseback riding, camping, swimming, tennis, and traveling. He said, \u201cIn a\nrecent letter former chancellor Deane W.

According to an obituary \u201cshe was quickly recognized\nas an excellent teacher, a capable counsellor, a just disciplinarian, and a person of\nstrong character, and high ideals\u201d (\u201cNun Who Taught 30 Years Dies\u201d).\n\nSister Catharine Francis Galvin continued her studies by taking mathematics\nclasses at Notre Dame during the summer sessions 1926\u201328 and in 1930. She received\na master\u2019s degree from Notre Dame in August 1930, graduating magna cum laude.\nIn 1933 she entered the Catholic University of America for further graduate work.\nShe was in residence at Catholic University 1933\u201335 and 1936\u201337. During 1935\u2013\n36 she returned to Holy Rosary Academy in Louisville as a high school teacher.\nAlthough she returned to St. Agnes College in Memphis in 1937, she also was a\nregistered student at Catholic 1937\u201338. She received her PhD in 1938 with minors in\nchemistry and physics. She remained on the faculty at St. Agnes College (renamed\nSiena College in 1939) except for a year, 1945\u201346, at Holy Rosary Academy. Over\nthe years her teaching assignments included chemistry, physics, and statistics, as\nwell as mathematics. Sister Catharine Francis was bursar at both the academy and\nthe college in Memphis and served as superior of her community for many years.\n\nSister Catharine Francis Galvin died at St. Joseph Hospital in Memphis, Ten-\nnessee, after an illness of two weeks.

October 20, 1893\u2013June 17, 1970.\nKnox College (BA 1916), Columbia University (MA 1921), Cornell University\n(PhD 1932).\n\nHelen Calkins was born in Quincy, Illinois, the \ufb01rst of two daughters of Anna\nBurns (Schermerhorn) (b. 1869) and Addison Niles Calkins (b. 1865), both of Illi-\nnois. Her parents married in October 1892. By 1900 her father was superintendent\nof Electric Wheelworks in Quincy. Her younger sister, Ruth Calkins, was born in\n1901 and later attended a business college in Quincy.\n\nHelen Calkins attended Quincy High School 1908\u201312 and Knox College in Gales-\nburg, Illinois, 1912\u201316. The year after her 1916 college graduation with special\nhonor in mathematics, she taught mathematics in junior high school in Quincy; the\nfollowing year she taught mathematics in the senior high school in Jacksonville, Illi-\nnois. She then returned to Knox College, where she was instructor in mathematics\n1918\u201320.\n\nCalkins began her graduate work in mathematics as a university scholar at\nColumbia University in 1920\u201321. While there she studied history of mathematics\nand the teaching of mathematics with David Eugene Smith, fundamental concepts\nwith Edward Kasner, and di\ufb00erential equations with W. B. Fite. She received her\nmaster\u2019s degree at the end of that academic year.\n\nCalkins returned to Knox College as instructor in 1921. She was promoted to\nassistant professor in 1922 but took a leave of absence from Knox in 1923 to return\nto Columbia. While at Knox she developed a course in the history of mathematics\ninspired by her earlier work at Columbia with Smith. She again held a scholarship at\nColumbia in 1923\u201324, when she studied Einstein\u2019s theory, in\ufb01nite series, di\ufb00erential\nequations, modern geometry, and the philosophy of mathematics. She continued her\nleave from Knox in 1924\u201325, when she traveled in the United States and Cuba. She\nattended Columbia part time during 1925\u201326 and traveled in Europe in the summer\nand fall of 1926.\n\nIn July 1926, in information submitted to the appointments bureau at Columbia,\nCalkins indicated that she would prefer to be near a good library, that she was a\nPresbyterian, and that she read and spoke German and Spanish. Calkins served\nas instructor at the University of Nebraska, substituting for someone on leave of\nabsence, during the second semester 1926\u201327. By the summer of 1927 she had\ncompleted residency requirements for the PhD degree at Columbia.\n\nCalkins was hired at Sweet Briar College for the year 1927\u201328 as professor of\nmathematics and acting head of the mathematics department, while Eugenie M.\nMorenus was on leave in England. Julia Wells Bower also joined the mathematics\nfaculty at Sweet Briar in 1927 and remained the next three years until she left\nto start her doctoral work at the University of Chicago. Calkins earned a salary of\n$2800 for the year and paid the college $450 to cover the cost of her room, board and\nlaundry at the college for the academic year. She lived in Professor Morenus\u2019s room,\nwhich was described by the president of Sweet Briar in a letter of June 27, 1927, as\n\u201ca very attractive front room in one of the faculty houses, in which the dining-room\nis situated where about eighteen members of the faculty have their meals\u201d (Faculty\nFiles, Sweet Briar College Archives). There were also arrangements for her small\ncoupe.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCALKINS - 2\n\nOn Janurary 17, 1930, the president of Sweet Briar summarized the quality of\nCalkins\u2019 work to a Chicago teacher\u2019s agency. \u201cWe were so much impressed with Miss\nCalkins\u2019 ability that it was with deep regret that we allowed her to leave. There\nis a lucidity of mind, an ability to present any matter with which she is dealing,\na gentleness and charm of personality, and an all-round sanity that will go far in\nacademic usefulness\u201d (Faculty Files, Sweet Briar College Archives).\n\nIn the summer of 1928 Calkins enrolled at Cornell and took classes through the\nsummer of 1930 as a scholarship holder. Her intended advisor, Charles F. Roos,\nleft Cornell for the AAAS in 1930, at the same time that Calkins took a job as\nprofessor and acting head of the department of Pennsylvania College for Women in\nPittsburgh. In May 1931 Roos was asked to stay on as her advisor, and he agreed to\ndo so as long as someone else at Cornell assumed joint responsibility with him. On\nMay 20, 1931, he wrote to F. K. Richtmyer, the dean of the graduate school, that\nCalkins was \u201cworking on a problem of maximizing a functional not of the ordinary\ncalculus of variations type\u201d and suggested David Clinton Gillespie as the person to\nbe the o\ufb03cial advisor since Calkins had taken a course in calculus of variations from\nhim (Box 69 C-1-C-5-C, Graduate School Records, Division of Rare and Manuscript\nCollections, Cornell University Library). Roos then described some aspects of her\nprogress and wrote, \u201cI think that Miss Calkins\u2019 thesis is of unusual interest.\u201d In\nher dissertation, which was approved in October 1931, she acknowledges both Roos\nand Wallie Abraham Hurwitz, whom she later listed as a personal friend; the degree\nwas awarded in February 1932.\n\nExcept for brief periods, Calkins spent the remainder of her career as professor\nand head of the department at Pennsylvania College for Women, where she was\nusually the only member of the mathematics department. It appears that upon her\narrival she initiated a student mathematics club known as Beta Chi, which existed\nduring most of her \ufb01rst decade there. She served on a number of standing faculty\ncommittees, especially those on the curriculum and the library. She also served on\nthe advisory board. During the summer of 1941, Calkins worked as a statistician\nin engineering defense training at Pennsylvania State College. She spent 1943\u201344\nat the University of Minnesota, where she taught mathematics to pre-\ufb02ight cadets.\nDuring the 1930s and 1940s Calkins consistently attended meetings of the Allegheny\nSection of the MAA. After having been on leave the year 1956\u201357, Calkins retired as\nprofessor emeritus in 1957, two years after the school changed its name to Chatham\nCollege (now University).\n\nCalkins was a member of Delta Delta Delta social sorority; Pi Lambda Theta,\nan education honor and professional association; the College Club of Pittsburgh;\nand the Daughters of the American Revolution. After her retirement, she moved\nback to Quincy, Illinois, where she was a member of the Quincy country club and\nthe First United Presbyterian Church.\n\nHelen Calkins died at age seventy-six in 1970 of arteriosclerotic heart disease\nat the Good Samaritan Home in Quincy, Illinois, where she had resided for about\nfour years.

June 16, 1903\u2013June 7, 2000.\nBrown University (Women\u2019s College) (PhB 1925), Brown University (MA 1927,\nPhD 1929).\n\nRose Alice Whelan was born in Brockton, Massachusetts, the \ufb01fth of six chil-\ndren of Mary Theresa (Manchester) (1864\u20131942) and Daniel Edward Whelan (1868\u2013\n1955). Her mother was born in Liverpool, England, immigrated to the United States\nin 1868, and was naturalized in 1892. Mary Whelan had no formal higher educa-\ntion but loved reading, music, and theater; she handled the family \ufb01nances and,\naccording to her granddaughter Norma Sedgewick Rockel, \u201cmanaged to \ufb01nd the\nmoney needed to give her children a higher education.\u201d Daniel Whelan was born\nin Massachusetts, and his formal education stopped at two years of high school; he\nwas, however, \u201can omnivorous reader with wide ranging interests\u201d (Rockel corre-\nspondence). He worked, mainly as a cutter, in a shoe factory. Norma Rockel also\nprovided a detailed account of the other children in the family. They were Louise\nManchester (1894\u20131984), who earned a bachelor\u2019s degree from Teachers College,\nColumbia University, and taught school in Massachusetts and New Jersey; Eliza-\nbeth Harford (1896\u20131974), who earned a BA and an MA in Guidance from Boston\nUniversity and taught school in Brockton, Massachusetts; Daniel Edward Jr. (1897\u2013\n1974), who earned a degree in civil engineering from Massachusetts Institute of\nTechnology and became dean of science at Loyola University in Los Angeles; John\nHenry (1900\u20131926), who went to sea for several years and died at age twenty-six;\nand Mary (1907\u20132000), who earned a BA from Brown University and an MA from\nTeachers College, Columbia University, and taught in Maryland and New Jersey.\n\nRose Whelan received her primary and secondary education in the public schools\nof Brockton, Massachusetts. While there she received the Benjamin Franklin Medal\nfor excellence in American history, an award that her grandmother, Johanna Louney,\nhad received. After her graduation from Brockton High School in 1921, Whelan en-\ntered Women\u2019s College in Brown University (Pembroke College in Brown University\nfrom 1928 until it merged with Brown in 1971). She received the PhB magna cum\nlaude in 1925, having been elected to Phi Beta Kappa in her junior year.\n\nWhelan remained at Brown University during 1925\u201326, as a part-time assistant\nin the mathematics department and as a graduate student in mathematics. She\ntaught in the Women\u2019s College before completing the work for her master\u2019s degree\nin September 1926. She received the degree in 1927, after having spent the academic\nyear 1926\u201327 as a resident fellow at Bryn Mawr College working primarily with\nAnna Pell Wheeler. A February 1928 statement of the Department of Mathematics\nat Brown regarding Whelan contains a quotation from Wheeler. \u201cMiss Rose Whelan\ntook two courses with me at Bryn Mawr College during the year \u201926\u2013\u201927. I found\nher a keen, thorough student. She has a questioning mind, and insists on settling\nall details, but also gets a good grasp of the subject as a whole. It was a great\npleasure to work with her. She will be a clear lecturer, and her personality will\nwin her students. She is very attractive in appearance and she has good health. Her\ninterest in Mathematics, and her capacity for work, speak well for her mathematical\ncareer in the future. I have great hopes for Miss Whelan\u201d (R. G. D. Richardson\nfolder, R. L. Moore Papers, Archives of American Mathematics). It was noted that\nshe was o\ufb00ered reappointment at Bryn Mawr for the year 1927\u201328 and that she was\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSEDGEWICK - 2\n\nnamed an alternate for the Margaret E. Maltby fellowship of the AAUW. However,\nWhelan returned to Brown for the 1927\u201328 year as holder of the Arnold fellowship.\nWhelan also taught a section of freshmen at Women\u2019s College while studying for\nher doctorate and writing her dissertation on boundary value problems in di\ufb00eren-\ntial equations under the direction of J. D. Tamarkin. In a letter of February 1928,\nR. G. D. Richardson, head of the department and dean of the graduate school at\nBrown, observed that Whelan would probably be \ufb01nished by September 1928, that\nthe dissertation should be publishable, and also that she had taught three summers\nat her former high school in Brockton, Massachusetts. He wrote, \u201cShe is one of the\npromising young women in Mathematics in the country. I wish it were possible to\nkeep her here, but there seems no opening commensurate with her abilities. The\ndepartment recommends her unreservedly for any position for which her experience\nand training \ufb01t her\u201d (R. G. D. Richardson folder, R. L. Moore Papers).\n\nDuring 1928\u201329 Whelan was an instructor at the University of Rochester and was\nsu\ufb03ciently near the completion of her doctoral work that an abbreviated version\nof her dissertation appeared in the Bulletin of the AMS in January 1929. Her 1929\ndegree was the \ufb01rst PhD in mathematics granted by Brown. After receiving her\ndoctorate, Whelan continued to teach at the University of Rochester. She was an\ninstructor until 1932 and an assistant professor 1932\u201334.\n\nOn December 25, 1932, Rose Whelan and Charles Hill Wallace Sedgewick were\nmarried in Brockton, Massachusetts. Charles H. W. Sedgewick was born in Nova\nScotia on August 21, 1902. He had worked as a bookkeeper and teller for a bank\nin Nova Scotia from 1917 to 1921 and as a high school teacher for two years after\ncompleting his bachelor\u2019s degree at Dalhousie University in 1925. In 1927 Sedgewick\nwent to Brown, where he was an assistant, instructor, and then fellowship holder\nuntil 1932. He received his master\u2019s degree in mathematics in 1930 and continued\nhis studies there until 1932, when he accepted an instructorship at Connecticut\nAgricultural College (from 1933 Connecticut State College and since 1939 the Uni-\nversity of Connecticut) at Storrs.\n\nAfter their marriage Rose Sedgewick returned to her teaching position in Roch-\nester, New York, and Charles Sedgewick returned to his position in Storrs, Con-\nnecticut. In October 1933 Mary Elizabeth (Malia), the \ufb01rst of their four children,\nwas born in Willimantic, Connecticut, near Storrs. In 1934 C. H. W. Sedgewick\nreceived his PhD in mathematics from Brown, he was promoted to assistant profes-\nsor at Connecticut, and Rose Sedgewick gave up her position at Rochester. Their\nthree other children were also born in Willimantic. They are Norma Louise, born in\nDecember 1935; John, born in July 1940; and Robert, born in December 1946. All\nof the children earned bachelor\u2019s degrees: Malia from the University of Connecticut\nin 1956, Norma with a major in physics from Bryn Mawr in 1956, and John and\nRobert with mathematics majors from Brown in 1962 and 1968, respectively. Malia\nalso earned an MA from Vanderbilt University and an EdD from the University of\nHawaii in 1987, and Robert earned an MA from Brown in 1969 and a PhD from\nStanford in 1975. All have had careers: Malia as a professor of nursing, Norma as\nan electronic systems engineer, John as a mathematician, and Robert as professor\nof computer science.\n\nCharles Sedgewick remained at the University of Connecticut until 1958. He was\nassistant professor 1934\u201341, associate professor 1941\u201346, and professor 1946\u201358.\nRose Sedgewick was an instructor at Connecticut for some years beginning in 1943\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSEDGEWICK - 3\n\nand ending in 1956. She also taught at Hillyer College (now part of the University\nof Hartford) 1955\u201358.\n\nIn 1958 C. H. W. Sedgewick moved to the US Census Bureau in Suitland, Mary-\nland, where he was a member of the sta\ufb00 of the industrial division 1958\u201361, chief\nof the foods section 1961\u201370, and supervisor of statistics from 1970 until his retire-\nment. Rose W. Sedgewick was hired as an instructor at the University of Maryland\nin 1958 and was promoted to assistant professor in 1961; she retired at that rank\nin 1969.\n\nThe Sedgewicks\u2019 daughter, Norma, wrote in 2000 that her parents played contract\nbridge and were both life masters in the American Contract Bridge League. She\nalso wrote that her mother \u201cwas an avid reader, as were all the Whelans, and read\na book almost every day, even well into her 90s.\u201d\n\nThe Sedgewicks moved from Maryland to Dunedin, on the west coast of Florida,\nin 1971. Two of Rose Sedgewick\u2019s sisters, Louise Whelan and Mary Whelan, also\neventually retired to Dunedin; Louise died there in 1984. Charles H. W. Sedgewick\ndied in Dunedin at the age of eighty-six on November 5, 1988.\n\nRose W. Sedgewick was living at the Mease Continuing Care facility in Dunedin\nwhere she died suddenly of a heart attack in June 2000, shortly before her ninety-\nseventh birthday. Her sister Mary had died in the same facility just six weeks ear-\nlier. Rose Sedgewick was a member of St. Michael the Archangel Catholic Church in\nnearby Clearwater, Florida. She was survived by her four children and ten grandchil-\ndren.

March 5, 1885\u2013September 24, 1967.\nSmith College (BA 1906, MA 1908), University of Chicago (MS 1914, PhD\n1916).\n\nPauline Sperry was born in Peabody, Massachusetts, the second of three chil-\ndren of Henrietta (Learoyd) (b. 1850) and Willard Gardner Sperry (b. 1847), both\nnatives of Massachusetts. Her mother studied at Abbot Academy in Andover, Mas-\nsachusetts, and between 1868 and 1878 served \ufb01ve years as a teacher and vice princi-\npal there. Her father graduated from Yale University in 1869. Her parents married\nin 1879. Willard Gardner Sperry was master of a high school in Massachusetts,\nserved for many years as pastor at Congregational churches in Massachusetts and\nNew Hampshire, received a doctor of divinity degree in 1893, was president of Olivet\nCollege in Michigan 1893\u20131904, and then became a minister in York Beach, Maine.\nPauline Sperry\u2019s siblings were Willard Learoyd (1882\u20131954) and Henrietta (1889\u2013\n1974). In 1885 the Sperrys bought a cottage in York County, Maine, which they\nowned for nearly \ufb01fty years, and to which they returned every summer. Her brother\nearned his bachelor\u2019s degree from Olivet College, was in the \ufb01rst group of American\nRhodes scholars to go to Oxford in 1904, earned master\u2019s degrees from Oxford and\nfrom Yale, became a clergyman and writer, and spent most of the latter years of\nhis life as dean of the Harvard Divinity School. Her sister graduated from Smith\nCollege and became a writer. She wrote a weekly food column for the New York\nTimes in the 1930s, wrote four books, and was a contributor to women\u2019s magazines.\nIn 1902 Pauline Sperry began her undergraduate work at Olivet College in Michi-\ngan, where her father was president until 1904. She then attended Smith College in\nNorthampton, Massachusetts, received her BA from Smith in 1906, and spent most\nof the \ufb01rst few years of her career there. The year after her graduation, she was\na teacher of mathematics at Hamilton Institute in New York City. The next year,\n1907\u201308, she was a fellow in music and mathematics at Smith, where she earned\na master\u2019s degree in music in 1908. Sperry remained at Smith as an assistant in\nmathematics 1908\u201311 and as instructor 1911\u201312. In 1910 she, her widowed mother,\nand her sister, who graduated from Smith that year, were living in Northampton.\nIn 1912\u201313 Pauline Sperry was a traveling fellow from Smith.\n\nSperry then studied at the University of Chicago and received her master\u2019s degree\nin mathematics in 1914. She was a fellow at Chicago 1915\u201316 and received her\ndoctorate in 1916 with a dissertation in projective di\ufb00erential geometry supervised\nby Ernest J. Wilczynski. Sperry returned to Smith as assistant professor for the year\n1916\u201317. During the 1917 summer session she taught at the University of California\nin Berkeley, at that time the only campus of the University of California, and joined\nthe faculty there as an instructor that autumn.\n\nSperry remained at the University of California for the rest of her career. She\nwas instructor 1917\u201323, assistant professor 1923\u201331, associate professor 1931\u201352,\nand associate professor emeritus from 1952. When appointed assistant professor,\nshe was the \ufb01rst woman in mathematics in a professorial rank at the University of\nCalifornia. Sperry taught graduate courses in di\ufb00erential geometry and supervised\nthe doctoral dissertations of \ufb01ve students at Berkeley: William Lawrence Hutch-\nings (1935), Philip Osborne Bell (1936), Raymundo Acosta Favila (1939), David\nBliss Dekker (1948), and Ting-Kwan Pan (1949). She was on leave the \ufb01rst half of\n1938\u201339 and was in Europe some of that time. During her sabbatical in the spring\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSPERRY - 2\n\nof 1949, Sperry was in Carmel, California, where she had spent many summers\nduring at least the previous two decades. In addition to her regular undergraduate\nand graduate teaching, in August 1943 she taught navigation to the University of\nCalifornia Navy ROTC.\n\nIn April 1920 the upper class and graduate women mathematics students at the\nUniversity of California formed a mathematics club, Mu Theta Epsilon, that had\nas one of its aims improved cooperation among students and faculty. All of the\nfaculty were honorary members but the students chose Pauline Sperry as their one\nactive faculty member. Although the latest mention of this club, described in 1925\nas a women\u2019s mathematics honor society, to appear in the American Mathematical\nMonthly was in January 1928, Sperry\u2019s mentoring of other women did not end\nthen, and, at least in the 1940s, she would take women graduate students to lunch\nin the Women\u2019s Faculty Club. She was also involved in the MAA, and served as vice\nchairman 1944\u201345 and then chairman 1945\u201346 of the Northern California Section.\nAlthough Sperry is listed as being an associate professor 1931\u201352, she did not\nserve as such 1950\u201352. Sperry was among the thirty-one professors dismissed from\nthe university in July 1950 because they would not sign a loyalty oath a\ufb03rming\n\u201cthat I am not a member of the Communist Party or any other organization which\nadvocates the overthrow of the Government by force or violence\u201d (Gardner, Cal-\nifornia Oath Controversy, 155). It was later reported that Sperry\u2019s \u201cconcern, and\nthus her refusal to sign, centered on the damage to the free and open atmosphere of\nthe university that followed the requirement of the oath\u201d (Innis, \u201cLessons from the\nControversy over the Loyalty Oath,\u201d 355). In October 1952 the California Supreme\nCourt ordered that the non-signers be reappointed and Sperry was given the rank\nassociate professor emeritus as of July 1952; further litigation brought her back pay\nfor 1950\u201352 in 1956.\n\nSperry was always proud of the stand she took in 1950 and explained in her\n1965 article, \u201cFormula for happiness at eighty,\u201d in the Smith Alumnae Quarterly\nthat she \u201chad always burned for causes\u201d (p. 154). She reiterated her commitment\nto civil liberties and noted that part of her formula \u201cis summed up in this phrase:\n\u2018Frugal spending and extravagant giving\u2019 \u201d (p. 155); she also described many of the\ngood deeds that represent her adherence to this part of the formula.\n\nDuring her years at the University of California and possibly for some years\nbefore, Sperry had a close friend in Alice Tabor (1878\u20131959), who had gone to the\nUniversity of California in 1916, a year before Sperry joined the faculty. Tabor had\nalso been a graduate student at the University of Chicago and earned a master\u2019s\ndegree from there in 1913 and a PhD in 1916, before joining the German department\nat California. For many years, starting at least by 1920, Sperry lived with Alice\nTabor and Tabor\u2019s mother in Berkeley; Tabor\u2019s mother died in 1948, the year\nthat Alice Tabor retired from the university, and Sperry and Tabor continued to\nshare a residence in Berkeley. At some point, by the early 1930s, they had built a\nhome in Carmel, California, on the Monterey Peninsula, in which they spent many\nsummers, and to which they moved permanently in 1950. The 1960 obituary of\nAlice Tabor by Sperry and others noted that at the University of California Tabor\nhad \u201cconceived the idea of the Friday Dinner Club, a group of faculty women who\ngathered monthly for many years to share their widespread and varied interests\nin research\u201d (1960, 50). The o\ufb03cial Faculty Women\u2019s Club was organized in 1919\nwith Sperry and Tabor responsible for the \ufb01nances and with Tabor as treasurer\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSPERRY - 3\n\nof the building committee. The clubhouse opened in 1923, and Sperry served as\ndirector of the club 1926\u201328.\n\nAfter she retired to Carmel, Sperry was active in the Monterey Peninsula Friends\u2019\nMeeting, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the American Friends Com-\nmittee on Legislation, the Committee for a Sane Nuclear Policy (SANE), and the\nLeague of Women Voters. Sperry\u2019s own religious beliefs and political commitments\nmay have been reinforced by her friendship with Tabor, who had a \u201cdeep concern for\nhuman welfare [that] was a natural inheritance from a long line of Quaker ancestors\nwho as abolitionists had sheltered slaves escaping to Canada, helped revolutionize\nthe treatment of the mentally ill, and pioneered in prison reform and in the Woman\nSu\ufb00rage Movement\u201d (1960, 50). Sperry reported to Smith College in 1957 that she\nhad been active in the local Democratic headquarters in the recent election. She\nwas in London in the summer of 1959.\n\nIn early 1961 Sperry reported that she had sold her home in Carmel and moved\nto Forest Hill Manor, a retirement community in Paci\ufb01c Grove, California. That\nsame year she received the Olivet College distinguished alumni award. She reported\nto Smith in February 1963 that she had broken her arm; a year later she noted that\nshe had made a three-month trip to England and New York by freighter. In April\n1964 Sperry reported as her chief interest the Step-by-Step School for impoverished\nchildren in Haiti. In 1967 Pauline Sperry died in Paci\ufb01c Grove at the age of eighty-\ntwo.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, AAUP, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi.\n\nTheses and dissertation:\n1908 The development of modern English oratorio.

December 22, 1898\u2013April 10, 1992.\nOur Lady of the Lake College (BA 1922), Catholic University of America\n(Catholic Sisters College) (MA 1926), Catholic University of America (PhD\n1935).\n\nMaria Anna Hill was born in Koerth, Texas, the \ufb01rst of two surviving daughters\nof Mary Bradley (Watson) (1866\u20131922), born in Georgia, and Thomas James Hill\n(1863\u20131936), from Texas. Her father had been married previously and had three\nsons with his \ufb01rst wife. At that time, he was in the livestock business. After his\n\ufb01rst wife died in 1891, he attended medical school in Louisville, Kentucky, settled\nin Seguin, Texas, and in 1893 moved to Koerth and married Mary Bradley Watson.\nHe practiced medicine and continued in the stock business. Their other surviving\ndaughter, Catherine Jane, was born in 1905. In 1912 the family moved to Yoakum,\nTexas, where Thomas Hill practiced medicine. His second wife died in 1922, and he\nremarried in 1923.\n\nMaria Hill started her schooling at age four in a public school before attending,\nafter one year, the Sacred Heart School in Hallettsville, near Koerth, and in 1913\u2013\n14 the St. Joseph School in Yoakum, where she was taught by the Sisters of Divine\nProvidence. She entered the convent of the Congregation of Divine Providence\n(CDP) in San Antonio in 1914, at age \ufb01fteen, and made her \ufb01rst profession in 1916.\nDuring the years 1916\u201322, Sister Mary Laetitia Hill taught and completed the\nwork for her bachelor\u2019s degree. She \ufb01rst taught at St. Mary\u2019s School in San Antonio;\nwhile there she taught high school, \ufb01fth grade, and kindergarten in the years 1916\u2013\n21; in second semester 1920\u201321, she taught in Our Lady of the Lake high school.\nShe taught at the Holy Family School in Tulsa, Oklahoma, from 1921 to 1925. In\nthe meantime, she received her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1922 from Our Lady of the Lake\nCollege (now Our Lady of the Lake University of San Antonio). In 1925\u201326, she\nstudied at the Catholic University of American and received her master\u2019s degree in\n1926.\n\nSister Mary Laetitia Hill taught at Our Lady of the Lake College, established by\nthe Sisters of Divine Providence, for forty-one years: as instructor 1926\u201332 and as\nprofessor 1935\u201370. The \ufb01rst six years she taught both mathematics and physics. In\n1932\u201335 she was at Catholic University studying for her doctorate in mathematics.\nWhile there she wrote her dissertation in algebraic geometry and received her PhD\nin 1935 with \ufb01rst minor physics and second minor mechanical engineering. Starting\naround the time she received her doctorate, Sister Mary Laetitia joined several\nprofessional organizations: the AMS in 1935, the American Association of Physics\nTeachers in 1936, and the American Physical Society in 1937. She also became a\nmember of the Texas Academy of Science and later joined the MAA and NCTM.\nFor nearly twenty-\ufb01ve years, starting in summer 1935, Sister Laetitia taught\nmathematics or physics or both during the school year and in most summer sessions.\nIn addition to her teaching at Our Lady of the Lake College, she also directed an\nNSF-sponsored summer institute for high school teachers at the college for six weeks\nin 1959. She then received an NSF grant to participate for eight weeks in 1962 in a\nsummer institute for college teachers of mathematics at Bowdoin College in Maine.\nAfter Sister Laetitia retired from Our Lady of the Lake College in 1969, she\nworked in the college accounting o\ufb03ce as a keypuncher until 1972. In 1972 she\nretired to the convent and Regan Hall for retired sisters. In July 1974 she came out\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHILL, Sr. M.

September 28, 1898\u2013December 5, 1964.\nWells College (BA 1920, MA 1922), Cornell University (PhD 1932).\n\nEvelyn Teresa Carroll was the daughter of Teresa (Caraher) (1867\u20131930) and\nWilliam J. Carroll (b. 1860), natives of New York. In June 1900 the family was living\nin Rome, New York, where she was born. At that time, her parents reported that\nthey had been married thirteen years; her mother had had two children, although\nonly Evelyn Carroll, then one year old, was living; and her father was owner of a\nknitting mill. In 1910 she had a six-year-old brother, William J. Jr. Although a\nbirth year of 1900 for Evelyn Carroll appears in later documents, the 1900 census\nand corroborating evidence point to the 1898 date above as correct.\n\nEvelyn T. Carroll received her preparation for college at Miss Lamphier\u2019s Private\nSchool and Rome Free Academy and then studied at Wells College, a women\u2019s\ncollege in Aurora, New York. After receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1920, Carroll\nbecame an instructor at Wells; she also continued her studies there and received a\nmaster\u2019s degree in 1922. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1924 and served\nas acting head of the department 1924\u201325. She studied at Columbia University\nduring the summer of 1924 and while on leave in 1927\u201328. Also in 1928 she worked\nfor the General Motors Export Company. She studied at Cornell University 1929\u201331\nand became associate professor at Wells upon her return in 1931, a semester before\nreceiving her doctorate from Cornell in February 1932. She wrote her dissertation\nin geometry under the direction of Virgil Snyder and had minors in analysis and\nalgebra.\n\nEvelyn Carroll married William Sener Rusk, an art historian at Wells, in Aurora\non August 31, 1932. William S. Rusk was born in Baltimore, Maryland, in 1892 and\nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree from Princeton University in 1915. He later received a\nmaster\u2019s degree in 1924 and a PhD in 1933 from Johns Hopkins University. Rusk\ntaught in preparatory schools before \ufb01rst joining the faculty at Wells College in\n1921. He taught for three years, 1925\u201328, at Dartmouth College, before returning\nto Wells as professor of \ufb01ne arts; he remained at Wells for thirty years until his\nretirement in 1968.\n\nEvelyn Carroll Rusk was promoted to professor in 1934. She published several\npapers and one review under the name Evelyn Carroll-Rusk in the 1930s and used\nthat form of her name in a few other professional contexts. She served as acting\ndean at Wells 1937\u201338 and became dean in 1938. While she was dean she was active\nin national and state associations for deans and was a member of the Cooperative\nBureau for Teachers, where she was on the board 1938\u201351 and served as chairman\nof the board 1940\u201342. She remained as dean and professor until 1951, when she\nresigned the deanship and took a year\u2019s sabbatical to study mathematics curricula\nat colleges and universities in the United States. During this leave she held a fel-\nlowship from the Ford Foundation Fund for the Advancement of Education. After\nreturning from her sabbatical year, Rusk returned to the mathematics department,\nand in 1954 she became chairman of the department.\n\nRusk was Roman Catholic and a Republican. In about 1940 she indicated that\nher favorite recreations were golf and bridge and that her hobby was dramatics.\nWhile at Wells she was very active in faculty theatre productions, one of which was\n\u201cHedda Gabler\u201d in 1947\u201348.

      "text": "PETERS, Ruth M. December 11, 1906\u2013May 12, 1961.\nBryn Mawr College (BA 1928, MA 1931), Radcliffe College (PhD 1933).\n\nRuth Margaret Peters was born in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, the second of three\nchildren of Julia (Clutz) (1881\u20131963), a native of Maryland, and Robert John Pe-\nters (b. ca. 1871) of Pennsylvania. Julia Clutz was the daughter of the president\n(1889\u20131904) of Midland College in Aitchison, Kansas, where Robert J. Peters was a\nprofessor of English 1904\u201309. Julia Clutz received a bachelor\u2019s degree from Midland\nCollege in 1899, graduated from Goucher College in 1901, and, it appears, received\nan MA in 1904 from a di\ufb00erent school.\n\nRuth Peters\u2019 brother, Robert, was a year older than she; her sister, Mary (1909\u2013\n1997), was two and a half years younger. In 1910 the family was living in Pittsburgh,\nwhere her father was a college professor. Her parents had been married for \ufb01ve\nyears, this being the second marriage for her father. In the 1920 census her father\u2019s\noccupation was listed as educational secretary; in 1930 he was called an executive\nwith the US government.\n\nPeters attended grade schools in Gettysburg and prepared for college at the Seiler\nSchool, a private school in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. The family was living in New\nCumberland, near Harrisburg, when Peters was in college. As an undergraduate\nmathematics major at Bryn Mawr, she held the Elizabeth Wilson White memorial\nscholarship her senior year. She graduated in 1928; the following year, 1928\u201329,\nPeters worked for the tra\ufb03c engineering department of the Bell Telephone Company\ndoing trunk analysis.\n\nIn 1929 Peters returned to Bryn Mawr for graduate work in mathematics and\nphysics and studied there as a scholar of the Society of Pennsylvania Women in New\nYork 1929\u201330 and as a fellow in mathematics 1930\u201331. Peters received her master\u2019s\ndegree in 1931, a year after her younger sister, Mary, received her bachelor\u2019s degree\nfrom Bryn Mawr and the same year that Mary received her master\u2019s degree in\nchemistry from Radcli\ufb00e College.\n\nIn 1931 Ruth Peters entered Radcli\ufb00e College to begin her doctoral work. While\nthere she wrote a minor thesis on equations of the \ufb01fth degree. She completed all\nher requirements, including her dissertation in Riemannian geometry, and received\nher PhD in 1933. Her \ufb01rst position after receiving her PhD in the depth of the\nDepression was as a personnel assistant doing job analysis for the Pennsylvania\nEmergency Relief Board.\n\nThe following year Peters went to Judson College, a small Baptist women\u2019s col-\nlege in Marion, Alabama, where she was assistant professor 1934\u201335 and associate\nprofessor 1935\u201336. She then took a position as professor of mathematics and physics\nat Lake Erie College, also a women\u2019s college, in Painesville, Ohio. She was there\n1936\u201343 and 1945\u201347. According to an item in the Monthly in 1943, she was granted\na leave of absence from Lake Erie College in order to serve as a research mathemati-\ncian with the applied mathematics group at Columbia University. Sometime prior\nto June 1943 she submitted a general application for employment to the Bryn Mawr\nalumnae o\ufb03ce listing her address as Lake Erie College; on the form she noted that\nshe was then working as an assistant physicist for the National Defense Research\nCouncil at Harvard and was seeking employment in the Boston area teaching math-\nematics or doing work in physics or statistics. Peters reported later that she was a\ntechnical aide in airborne \ufb01re control, guided missiles, and rockets for the O\ufb03ce of\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nPETERS - 2\n\nScienti\ufb01c Research and Development at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\n1943\u201345 and that she did research on the theory of errors in bombing.\n\nTwo years after returning to Lake Erie College, Peters went to St. Lawrence\nUniversity in Canton, New York. She was associate professor 1947\u201355 and professor\n1955\u201358. While there she served as department chairman for two years. She also held\na National Science Foundation faculty fellowship at Harvard the second semester\n1957\u201358 and was president of the New York Lambda chapter of Phi Beta Kappa\nin the late 1950s. In the mid-1950s, Peters indicated that she was a member of the\nLeague of Women Voters and was interested in oil painting and gardening.\n\nIn 1958 Peters went to the University of New Hampshire as associate professor.\nShe was there only two years before she had to take a medical leave in October\n1960. Peters\u2019 mother had lived with her from at least 1953, before Peters became\nill. Ruth Peters then moved to her sister\u2019s home in Belmont, Massachusetts. She\ndied from cancer in a Boston hospital at age \ufb01fty-four in 1961 and was survived by\nher mother, sister, and brother.\n\nThree years after Peters\u2019 death, Mary Fieser, her sister and coauthor with Louis\nF. Fieser of standard texts in organic chemistry, established an award at the Uni-\nversity of New Hampshire in her memory. The award description notes that one of\nRuth Peters\u2019 prime interests was discovering outstanding students and encouraging\ntheir development.

      "text": "SULLIVAN, Sister M. Helen. April 10, 1907\u2013December 22, 1998.\nSt. Benedict\u2019s College (BA 1930), Catholic University of America (MA 1931,\nPhD 1934).\n\nMonica Elizabeth Sullivan was the fourth of nine children of Mary E. (Majerus) (1876\u2013\n1947) and John Edward Sullivan (b. 1873), both from Rulo in the southeastern corner\nof Nebraska. Her mother graduated from high school in nearby Falls City; her father\nattended Nebraska State Normal School (now Peru State College) and St. Benedict\u2019s\nCollege in Atchison, Kansas. He was a teacher for eight years before becoming a banker,\nland owner, and community leader in Kansas. Her parents were married in 1897 and lived\nin Rulo until after the birth of their second son in 1903. The family then moved across the\nstate line to E\ufb03ngham, Kansas, where the seven youngest children were born. The other\nchildren in the family were: Paul Justin (1899\u20131950), Leo Bernard (1903\u20131978), Nellie\nC. (1905\u20131980), Edward Stephen (b. 1909), Agnes (1912\u20131987), Mary Margaret (Sister\nBede) (1915\u20131993), Rita (b. 1917), and Teresa Catherine (b. 1920). Of these, all had some\ncollege education, one became a priest, and one became a Benedictine Sister.\n\nElizabeth Sullivan attended parochial schools in Kansas: in E\ufb03ngham 1913\u201319, at St.\nPeter\u2019s parish grade school in Mercier 1919\u201320, and at Mount St. Scholastica Academy\nin Atchison 1921\u201325. After graduating as class valedictorian in 1925, she attended Mount\nSt. Scholastica Junior College 1926\u201328 and then St. Benedict\u2019s College 1928\u201330. Mount\nSt. Scholastica did not grant degrees as a senior college until 1932.\n\nSullivan joined the Benedictine Sisters in 1925, professed into the Order of St. Benedict\nin 1930, and as Sister Mary Helen Sullivan continued her studies at the Catholic University\nof America. In 1981 she described the situation at that time.\n\nAs a young sister, just as I was \ufb01nishing college, my superior called me\nand said she would like me to go into physics, and I said, \u201cphysics?\u201d Then\nshe said, \u201cWell, what do you like?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell, I like languages\nand philosophy.\u201d She said, \u201cWell, we need somebody in physics.\u201d So I\nsaid, \u201cWell, okay I\u2019ll give it a try.\u201d So I went to Catholic University and\nI got my master\u2019s in physics in \u201931. I learned, meanwhile, that you build\nyour own equipment and you do this sort of thing. It wasn\u2019t very enticing\nto think I was going to be engaging in building equipment when I got\nthis degree. So I talked to her and also I got ill for a period in there,\nand I think she realized that probably this was going to be too much of\na strain. So, we talked to the dean of the graduate school and . . . it was\nno problem to switch me over to math. (Smithsonian meeting tapes)\n\nThree years after receiving her master\u2019s degree, she earned her doctorate in mathemat-\nics with a dissertation directed by Aubrey E. Landry and with a minor in physics and\nmechanics.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD in 1934, Sister M. Helen Sullivan returned to Mount St. Scholas-\ntica College, where she had taught in the summer of 1931. She reported in 1981 that \u201cone\nof the advantages of going into a religious community is you don\u2019t have to seek your jobs;\nI was assigned. I came home with my degree and started teaching everything in the pro-\ngram that I could handle. I taught \ufb01fteen hours my \ufb01rst year and believe you me it wasn\u2019t\neasy. It is probably one of the reasons I had to have sick leave. . . (Smithsonian meeting\ntapes 1981). Emma Olson replaced her and served as acting head of the department sec-\nond semester 1934\u201335, and M. Gweneth Humphreys replaced Sister Helen as head of the\ndepartment 1935\u201336. Sister Helen was away during two more early periods because of\nillness.\n\nSister Helen remained at the college, except for leaves, sabbaticals, and other experi-\nences, until 1970, after which Mount St. Scholastica and St. Benedict\u2019s o\ufb03cially merged to\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSULLIVAN, Sr. M. H. - 2\n\nbecome Benedictine College. She was instructor 1934\u201337, assistant professor 1938\u201345, pro-\nfessor 1945\u201370, and professor emeritus after 1970. Sister Jo Ann Fellin, retired Benedictine\nCollege faculty member, relayed to one of the authors that in addition to two sabbatical\nleaves at universities, Sister Helen was away 1937\u201338, 1945\u201346, and 1954\u201357, and that at\ntwo intervals she \u201cwas assigned to administrative work as principal in Louisiana, Iowa,\nand Kansas.\u201d\n\nSister Helen was chairman of the mathematics department 1934\u201354 and after her re-\nturn from a three-year leave in 1957; she was chairman of the division of mathematics and\nnatural sciences 1963\u201370. In about 1936 she organized Euclid\u2019s Circle, the mathematics\nclub that preceded the founding by her in 1940 of the Kansas Gamma chapter of Kappa\nMu Epsilon. In 1981 Sister Helen wrote that, \u201cmy entire teaching career has been both\nsuccessful and happy. Of special signi\ufb01cance to me was my Undergraduate Research Pro-\ngram funded by N.S.F. [1963\u201367]. Because of this, students of mine had eighteen published\npapers. Our mathematics program was an Honors Program and we have many Master\u2019s\nDegrees and seven or eight doctorates. This, I feel, is unusual for a small liberal arts college\nfor women in the mid-West\u201d (Smithsonian questionnaire). Furthermore, during her last\nfew years there, Sullivan was the campus coordinator of the junior year abroad program\nfor the Institute of European Studies.\n\nDuring the period Sister Helen was at Mount St. Scholastica College, she engaged in\npost-doctoral study, held a number of visiting positions, and participated in various na-\ntional professional organizations. She engaged in research and study at Universit\u00b4e Laval,\nQuebec City, Canada, summer 1950; the University of Oklahoma, Norman, summer 1962;\nand Clare College, Cambridge University, England, summer 1964. She was a visiting pro-\nfessor at Loyola University (then referred to as Loyola University of the South and now\no\ufb03cially Loyola University New Orleans) 1948\u201349 and summer 1949. During that summer\nshe taught using her notes, \u201cThe Christian Approach to Science: A Philosophic Integration\nfor Science Majors in Liberal Arts Colleges.\u201d A copy of these typewritten notes is among\nthe papers Sullivan donated to the Smithsonian Institution in 1981. In the summers of\n1953 and 1954 she was a visiting professor at Fort Smith Junior College (now University of\nArkansas Fort Smith), and in summer 1968 she was also a visiting professor at Wesleyan\nUniversity in Connecticut.\n\nSullivan was an NSF visiting lecturer in the graduate school of the University of Detroit\nin summers 1960 and 1963 and taught in NSF summer institutes at Rosary Hill College\nin Bu\ufb00alo, New York, in 1965, and at Cla\ufb02in University, a historically black university\nin Orangeburg, South Carolina, in 1965 and 1966. Also in 1966 she took a course at\nRockhurst College in Kansas City, Missouri, and participated in workshops at Argonne\nNational Laboratory near Lemont, Illinois, in order to be able to introduce a computer\ncourse at Mount St. Scholastica. She was visiting professor at the University of Minnesota\nand, part time, at the College of St. Catherine in St. Paul, Minnesota, during 1964\u201365\nwhile on sabbatical leave. While in Minnesota, Sullivan participated in the NSF sponsored\nCollege Geometry Project as part of a textbook writing team.\n\nDuring the 1960s Sullivan\u2019s activities were reported in the Mount St. Scholastica Kappa\n\nMu Epsilon periodical The Exponent. The October 1965 issue noted that\n\nSister Helen spent six weeks this summer teaching in a N.S.F. Institute at\nCla\ufb02in University . . . . She taught two sections of \u201cFoundations of Mod-\nern Mathematics\u201d to 65 Institute members, all of whom were Negroes.\n\nWhen asked how she received this assignment, Sister Helen explained\nthat she had remarked last March in St. Paul that she would rather teach\nthe Negro than join in a \u201cSympathy-for-Selma\u201d march. A few days later\nshe received a letter asking her to do just that at Cla\ufb02in Univeristy. (p.\n2)\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSULLIVAN, Sr. M. H. - 3\n\nAmong her many professional activities were several sponsored by NSF. In addition to\nher involvement with the undergraduate research program at Mount St. Scholastica and\nthe visiting lectureships noted above, she was NSF visiting lecturer for high schools in\nKansas; she was a participant in three NSF institutes for college teachers of mathematics;\nshe was a member of an eight-person writing team at the University of Minnesota to\nproduce college geometry materials; and she served on NSF panels to read and evaluate\nproposals in Washington, D.C.\n\nSister Helen was also active in mathematical organizations. Her work with MAA in-\ncluded contributing to the Guidance Pamphlet issued by the Post-War Commission of the\nMAA, serving on the state committee appointed by MAA to evaluate standards proposed\nby CUPM for undergraduate mathematics programs, and serving as the vice chairman\nof the Kansas Section 1946\u201347 and chairman 1947\u201348. She was often faculty sponsor of\nthe Mount St. Scholastica chapter of the mathematics honor society Kappa Mu Epsilon.\nA scholarship was established in 1965 by the alumnae of the Kansas Gamma Chapter of\nKappa Mu Epsilon and named the Sister Helen Sullivan scholarship in her honor in 1967.\nHer contributions to the national Kappa Mu Epsilon, which included serving as national\nhistorian 1943\u201347 and as assistant editor of its journal Pentagon 1943\u201347 and 1961\u201370,\nwere \ufb01rst recognized when she was named one of \ufb01fty Distinguished Members of KME at\ntheir \ufb01ftieth anniversary celebration in 1981. Ten years later KME honored her with the\nGeorge R. Mach Distinguished Service Award.\n\nAfter Sullivan left Mount St. Scholastica College in 1970, she held a variety of teaching,\nstudying, and administrative positions both abroad and in this country. In the spring of\n1970, as a member of an international curriculum committee of the Institute of European\nStudies, she made on-site evaluations of study centers of some major European universities.\nIn the summer of 1970 she was an American consultant in mathematics for US AID at the\nUniversity of Aurangabad, India. This was followed by a year on sabbatical leave, 1970\u201371,\nas visiting professor under the International Cultural Exchange in Ireland at University\nCollege, Galway. The following year she was consultant, academic counselor, and tutor in\nmathematics at the Institute of European Studies at the University of Vienna in Austria.\nAfter returning to this country she served as director of development at Lillis High\nSchool in Kansas City 1972\u201373 and as assistant director, Diocesan O\ufb03ce of Education in\nBillings, Montana, 1973\u201375. The following year she engaged in graduate study in theology\nat Gonzaga University in Seattle.\n\nIn 1976 Sister Helen moved to Berkeley, California, where she remained for most of the\nnext decade. While there she was research assistant to the dean and faculty, Jesuit School\nof Theology, 1976\u201377; assistant to the president, Graduate Theological Union, 1977\u201378;\nassistant to the president of the School of Applied Theology 1978\u201379; and development\nresearch specialist for Catholic Charity Services in Oakland 1978\u201381. In the early 1980s, she\nwas a member of spiritual direction and retreat teams at the School of Applied Theology\nin Berkeley.\n\nSister Helen Sullivan returned to Atchison, Kansas, in 1985 and lived in the Dooley\nCenter, a care facility at Mount St. Scholastica Monastery. She died there in 1998 at age\nninety-one. Burial was in the Sisters\u2019 Cemetery.\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, NCTM, AWM, Math. Assoc. of Great Britain,\nAmer. Phys. Soc., Nat.

The other\nchildren in the family were William Marion (1900\u20131997), Miriam (1902\u20131989), Kenneth\nArchibald (1904\u20131996), Angus Donald (1907\u20131982), Emily Christine (1909\u20131995), Vivian\n(1914\u20132003), and Miza (1916\u20131989).\n\nMildred Taylor graduated from the high school in Virginia, Illinois, in 1917 and entered\nOxford College for Women in Ohio that fall. In 1918\u201319 and 1920\u201321 she was a special\nstudent at Miami University doing course work in physics. While at Oxford College, which\nmerged with Miami University in 1928, she was involved in many activities including the\nathletic association and YWCA all four years. After her graduation in 1921, she received a\nscholarship from the University of Illinois for the year 1921\u201322. She received her master\u2019s\ndegree in 1922 and taught the next year in the Johnston City Township high school in\nsouthern Illinois.\n\nFrom 1923 until 1929 Taylor taught as an instructor at Knox College in Galesburg,\nIllinois. During this time she was working toward her PhD at the University of Illinois\nand regularly attended meetings of the Illinois Section of the MAA. She took a leave of\nabsence from Knox 1929\u201330 to spend her only full year in residence at the University of\nIllinois. All of her other course work occurred during the summers 1924 to 1926 and 1927\nto 1930. She received her doctorate in 1931 with a dissertation in algebraic geometry and\nwith a minor in physics.\n\nIn 1930 Taylor was hired as professor of mathematics and department head at Mary\nBaldwin College in Staunton, Virginia. This college for women, originally chartered in\n1845, became \ufb01rst a seminary, then a junior college, and in 1923 a four-year college. When\nTaylor arrived in 1930 there were approximately 250 students. In 1937 her title changed\nto professor of mathematics and astronomy. She remained at Mary Baldwin until her\nretirement in 1968. Throughout her career at Mary Baldwin, Taylor attended national\nmeetings of the AMS and the MAA and meetings of the Maryland-District of Columbia-\nVirginia Section of the MAA. In 1938 she was elected to the executive committee of the\nsection, and in 1953 she was elected its vice chair.\n\nTaylor was also active in Pi Mu Epsilon, Sigma Delta Epsilon, and the AAUW. She\nwas chair of the national alumnae committee of Sigma Delta Epsilon 1942\u201343 and was\nsecretary of the Virginia branch of the AAUW in 1940\u201341. She attended a number of\nannual meetings of the NCTM in the 1950s; she was chairman of the ushers and secretaries\ncommittee in Chicago in 1950, and she gave talks about teaching geometry at the college\nlevel in Atlantic City and Cincinnati in 1953 and 1954. She indicated in about 1940 that\nshe was a Presbyterian and a Republican.\n\nMildred Taylor was living in Staunton, Virginia, at the time of her death at age eighty\nin 1978. She was survived by her three brothers and four sisters. The funeral service was\nheld at the First Presbyterian Church in Staunton, and she was buried in East Lawn\nMemorial Park in Urbana, Illinois.\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, NCTM, AAAS, Sigma Delta Epsilon, AAUW,\nPi Mu Epsilon.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nTAYLOR - 2\n\nDissertation:\n1931 A determination of the types of planar Cremona transformations with not more\nthan 9 F -points.

June 27, 1899\u2013November 9, 1981.\nUniversity of Washington (BS 1921, MS 1923), University of Chicago (PhD\n1927).\n\nLois Wilfred Gri\ufb03ths was born in Chagrin Falls, Ohio, the second of two children\nof Lena (Jones) (1872\u20131956) and Frederick William Gri\ufb03ths (1867\u20131932). Some\nsources give her mother\u2019s birthplace as Iowa and others as Kansas. Her mother\ngraduated from the elementary course at the Kansas State Normal School in Em-\nporia (now Emporia State University) in 1894 and taught school at various times;\nin 1894 her home address was given as Lehigh, Indian Territory (now Oklahoma).\nF. W. Gri\ufb03ths was born in Wales, immigrated to the United States in 1880, did\nhis precollege schooling in New York State, and received a BA degree from Oberlin\nCollege in 1893. He earned a BD degree from Oberlin Theological Seminary in 1896\nand was ordained a Congregational minister before marrying Lena Jones on Decem-\nber 31, 1896, in Ardmore, Indian Territory (now Oklahoma). F. W. Gri\ufb03ths was a\nminister in Michigan 1896\u201397, in Ohio 1898\u201399, and in Jennings, Oklahoma Terri-\ntory, 1899\u20131900 before traveling for the Minneapolis Journal 1900\u201304. The family\nmoved to Seattle in 1904, and F. W. Gri\ufb03ths was a pastor for a few years, was\nvice president of a title guaranty and abstract company 1908\u201310, and was princi-\npal and then superintendent of schools outside of Seattle until 1919. He was senior\nclerk in the accounting department of a railroad company in Seattle from 1920\nuntil his death a dozen years later. Lois Gri\ufb03ths\u2019 older brother, Harold Frederick,\nwas born in 1898, also in Ohio, and after studying three years at the University of\nWashington, served in the Navy and later went into business in Seattle.\n\nLois Gri\ufb03ths received her elementary and secondary education in the public\nschools in the state of Washington before entering the University of Washington.\nSome of the time she was at Washington, she served as assistant to the comptroller\nof the university. Among her professors was E. T. Bell. She received her bachelor\u2019s\ndegree in 1921 and her master\u2019s degree two years later.\n\nGri\ufb03ths entered the University of Chicago in October 1925 and attended for\nseven quarters. She completed her dissertation under the direction of L. E. Dickson\nand in her dissertation vita thanked Professors E. H. Moore, Bell, G. A. Bliss, and\nDickson for their guidance and inspiration.\n\nAfter receiving her doctorate in 1927, Gri\ufb03ths was immediately hired by North-\nwestern University in Evanston, Illinois, for what was to be her only teaching po-\nsition. She was instructor 1927\u201330, assistant professor 1930\u201338, associate professor\n1938\u201364, and emeritus associate professor after her retirement in 1964. Her promo-\ntion to associate professor came after she had spent part of her 1936\u201337 sabbatical in\nCambridge, England. In 1947 Gri\ufb03ths published a textbook that was an expansion\nof typewritten notes she had copyrighted in 1945 as \u201cDeterminants and Systems of\nLinear Equations\u201d and in 1946 as \u201cIntroduction to the Theory of Equations.\u201d In\nthe late 1940s she produced two additional sets of notes, \u201cOutline of the Theory\nof Groups\u201d (c1948) and \u201cMatrices and Linear Dependence\u201d (c1949), but did not\npublish either of them.\n\nGri\ufb03ths published a dozen research articles over a twenty-one year period. These\narticles appeared in the American Journal of Mathematics, the Annals of Mathe-\nmatics, and the Bulletin of the AMS. In 1942 she published an expository article in\nthe American Mathematical Monthly on representing numbers as sums of polygonal\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGRIFFITHS - 2\n\nnumbers; between 1930 and 1945, seven of her eight research papers were concerned\nwith polygonal numbers. The eighth, \u201cOn hypergroups, multigroups, and product\nsystems,\u201d appeared in 1938 and was referenced by other authors at least through\n1986. From 1939 through the early 1940s, Gri\ufb03ths also reviewed textbooks for the\nNational Mathematics Magazine and regularly served as a referee for the Bulletin\nof the AMS in the early 1930s and for the Monthly through most of the 1940s.\n\nAt various times Gri\ufb03ths spoke to both the junior and the senior mathematics\nclubs at the University of Chicago, to the Northwestern mathematics club, and\nto the Women\u2019s Mathematics Club of Chicago. She was a charter member of the\nNorthwestern chapter of Sigma Delta Epsilon. In 1952 she was given an honorary\nlife membership in the Northwestern University Alumni Association. Her papers at\nNorthwestern University include teaching \ufb01les, material related to her publications,\nand mathematical correspondence, particularly with E. T. Bell in the 1940s. She\nalso maintained a close relationship with the University of Chicago and attended\nseminars and meetings of the senior mathematics club there.\n\nGri\ufb03ths and her mother made a trip to Europe in 1935 and returned to the\nUnited States in September of that year. Her mother came to live with her in the\nmid-1940s and remained until her mother\u2019s death in Evanston in 1956. In about\n1940, Gri\ufb03ths indicated that her favorite recreation was walking. Acquaintances\nof Gri\ufb03ths told one of the authors that she loved to garden and to cook and liked\nclassical music and kept notes on what she listened to on the radio.\n\nLois Gri\ufb03ths remained in Evanston after her retirement and died in nearby\nSkokie in 1981 as a result of heart disease; she was eighty-two years old at the time\nof her death in the Old Orchard Manor Nursing Home. She bequeathed her house\nto the University of Chicago and had provided that her body be used for scienti\ufb01c\nstudy after her death.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Sigma Delta Epsilon, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma\nXi.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1923 Contact curves of the rational cubic.

June 14, 1915\u2013.\nBarnard College (BA 1935), Bryn Mawr College (MA 1936, PhD 1938).\n\nMarion Belle Greenebaum is the third of three daughters of Anna (Rheinhold)\n(1876\u20131927), born in Germany, and Milton Greenebaum (1876\u20131976), born in Bal-\ntimore, Maryland. Her mother, who attended the Normal College of the City of\nNew York (now Hunter College), was a teacher; her father, who attended the New\nYork City public schools and was self-educated, was an importer and exporter. Her\nparents married in October 1907. Their three daughters were born in Brooklyn, and\nall later earned bachelor\u2019s degrees from Barnard College. Marion Greenebaum\u2019s sis-\nters, Celine (1910\u20132003) and Helen (b. 1912), both did graduate studies in social\nwork and became licensed social workers.\n\nMarion Greenebaum attended Erasmus Hall High School in Brooklyn 1927\u201331\nand was awarded the Julia M. Dennis memorial scholarship at the time of her\ngraduation. She was also recognized as one of two obtaining the highest average in\nmathematics in a graduating class of more than \ufb01ve hundred. She entered Barnard\nCollege at age sixteen and graduated four years later with a major in mathematics.\nAthletics were among her activities at Barnard, and in the spring of her senior year\nshe received a senior service award and numerals in basketball and tenikoit (also\nknown as ring tennis) from the Barnard College Athletic Association. She was later\nthe fund chair for her class.\n\nAfter receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1935, Greenebaum immediately began\nher graduate work in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College; she earned her master\u2019s\ndegree a year later and her doctorate two years after that, at age twenty-three. She\nheld a graduate scholarship in mathematics 1935\u201337 and a resident fellowship in\nmathematics 1937\u201338. Having become interested in abstract algebra when Nathan\nJacobson was at Bryn Mawr her \ufb01rst year and \ufb01nding no one on the faculty in that\narea at Bryn Mawr, she wrote her dissertation in algebraic number theory under\nthe direction of H. W. Brinkmann of nearby Swarthmore College.\n\nGreenebaum\u2019s \ufb01rst position was as a research statistician with the International\nStatistical Bureau in New York City, where she worked from June 1938 until June\n1939 doing economic statistical research for $25 a week. On June 25, 1939, she mar-\nried Jess Epstein, a research engineer who worked for RCA Manufacturing Company\nin New Jersey. Epstein, born in Cincinnati, Ohio, in 1907, received a bachelor\u2019s de-\ngree in 1932 and a master\u2019s degree in 1934 from the University of Cincinnati after\nworking as a co-op engineer for the Crosley Radio Corporation in Ohio 1926\u201331.\nHe was an instructor of physics at the Cincinnati College of Pharmacy for one\nyear before moving to his position with RCA in New Jersey in 1935. Jess Epstein\nremained with the RCA Manufacturing Company as research engineer until 1942,\nwhen RCA Laboratories opened in Princeton, New Jersey. He then worked at RCA\nLaboratories as research engineer 1942\u201362, as technical administrator of the Mis-\nsile and Surface Radar Division 1962\u201367, and as sta\ufb00 engineer from 1967 until his\nretirement in 1973.\n\nIn May 1940 Marion Epstein wrote to Helen Owens that \u201cunfortunately circum-\nstances have kept me out of the academic \ufb01eld and I have turned my activities more\ntoward the \ufb01eld of statistics and economic research\u201d (Owens Papers). In her 1940\nquestionnaire she reported that she was engaged in some volunteer social service\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nEPSTEIN - 2\n\nwork and some independent research. The \ufb01rst of the Epsteins\u2019 three children, Pe-\nter, was born on May 24, 1941, in Moorestown, New Jersey. Their two daughters,\nBarbara and Judith, were born in Princeton on December 16, 1943, and on January\n7, 1948, respectively. All of the children earned master\u2019s degrees, married, and are\nor have been working in urban planning, education-related jobs, and therapy and\ncounseling.\n\nIn 1944 Marion G. Epstein returned to work part time with the Educational\nTesting Service (ETS) in Princeton, New Jersey, where she remained, with some\nbreaks, for the rest of her career. She worked in the Test Development Division\nuntil 1973. From 1944 to 1948, when her \ufb01rst two children were young, she worked\nas an associate examiner in mathematics about three hours a day, mainly on actu-\narial exams. When her youngest daughter was born in 1948, she stopped working at\nETS for a time. In 1954, when her daughter entered school, she resumed part-time\nwork as a professional associate in mathematics. In 1962 she began full-time work\nas senior examiner in mathematics. In this position she was responsible for gradu-\nate record exams, advanced placement exams, upper level college board tests, the\noriginal development of CLEP general mathematics examinations, development of\ncomputer assisted assembly of tests, and was project director for actuarial exami-\nnations. She became assistant director of the division in 1967 and associate director\nin 1968. She noted in 1981 that during her years with mathematics test develop-\nment she worked closely with many mathematicians; she cited, in particular, A.\nW. Tucker and Samuel Wilkes of Princeton University and E. P. Vance of Oberlin\nCollege as having had special in\ufb02uence on her.\n\nIn 1973 Epstein moved to the College Board Programs Division of ETS, where she\ncontinued her administrative work. She was director of development and analysis\n1973\u201375, administrative director of professional services (test development, publica-\ntions, statistical analysis, and systems) 1975\u201377, and vice president 1977\u201380. After\nJuly 1980 she was senior advisor to the senior vice president for programs.\n\nIn connection with her work in educational testing, Epstein was engaged in\ncurriculum writing for the School Mathematics Study Group (SMSG) during the\nsummers of 1959 and 1960. She also served as consultant for test development\nworkshops with teachers of mathematics for the West African Examinations Council\nin Ghana and Nigeria in the spring of 1964 and for the University of London School\nExaminations Department in the spring of 1967. Other consulting work included\nworking with the NSF Institute for Teachers of Advanced Placement at Michigan\nState University.\n\nEpstein was active and in\ufb02uential in a number of positions related to education.\nShe was a member of the Princeton Township Board of Education 1955\u201366; she was\nvice president 1958\u201361 and president 1961\u201363.

October 27, 1907\u2013September 14, 1980.\nOberlin College (BA 1928, MA 1929), University of Pennsylvania (PhD 1936).\n\nVivian Eberle Spencer was born in New Castle, Pennsylvania, the elder of two\ndaughters of Ina M. (Eberle) (b. 1879) and Andrew Berger Spencer (b. 1869), both\nof whom were born in Pennsylvania. At the time of the 1910 census her parents had\nbeen married four years, and her maternal grandparents lived with them in New\nCastle; ten years later they still lived in New Castle, and her maternal grandmother\nhad died. Her father was a traveling salesman throughout his life and was able\nto be with the family infrequently; he sold furniture in 1910 and stock in 1920.\nHer sister, Domina Eberle, was born in September 1920 and also earned a PhD\nin mathematics. Domina Spencer received her doctorate from MIT in 1942 under\nthe direction of Dirk J. Struik and has spent the major part of her career on\nthe faculty at the University of Connecticut in Storrs. She is one of the thirty-six\nwomen interviewed by Margaret A. M. Murray for her book Women Becoming\nMathematicians: Creating a Professional Identity in Post-World War II America.\nVivian Spencer was taught at home, mainly by her mother, before enrolling in\nOberlin College in 1924. At that time the family moved to Oberlin, Ohio, where\nthey remained for most of the next decade. At Oberlin Vivian Spencer majored in\nmathematics and English and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1928. She remained\nat Oberlin and received a master\u2019s degree in mathematics the following year. From\n1929 until 1933 she was a graduate assistant in mathematics at the University of\nPittsburgh during the academic year and studied at the University of Chicago dur-\ning several of the summers. In fall 1933 Vivian Spencer entered the graduate school\nat the University of Pennsylvania. Her family joined her in Philadelphia, where her\nthirteen-year-old sister, Domina, had her \ufb01rst formal schooling and continued to re-\nceive mathematical instruction from Vivian. During 1933\u201334 Vivian Spencer was a\nBennett fellow at the University of Pennsylvania and took courses from F. W. Beal,\nArnold Dresden (of Swarthmore College), J. R. Kline, J. A. Shohat, and Anna Pell\nWheeler (of Bryn Mawr College). The following year she held a Moore fellowship,\ntook courses from Shohat and Hans Rademacher, and was admitted to candidacy\nfor the PhD in February 1935. During the fall of 1935 she was a research assistant,\nin May 1936 she passed her PhD examination, and in June 1936 she received her\nPhD.\n\nAlthough Spencer no longer had a position at the University of Pennsylvania\nafter the \ufb01rst semester 1935, she remained in Philadelphia and in January 1936\nbecame a statistical research assistant for the National Research Project (NRP)\nof the Works Progress Administration (WPA); she also worked as an associate\nstatistician for the US Bureau of Mines. She did research on fuel e\ufb03ciency and\nlabor production, and, in addition to authoring NRP reports, she contributed to\nthe NRP volumes Production, Employment, and Productivity in 59 Manufacturing\nIndustries and Technology, Employment, and Productivity in Petroleum and Nat-\nural Gas Production. During 1936\u201337, while employed by the WPA, she audited a\ngraduate course in advanced economic statistics at the University of Pennsylvania.\nIn January 1940 Spencer moved to Washington, D.C., where she became a min-\neral economist and statistician for the US Department of Commerce. She worked for\nthe US Bureau of the Census within the Department of Commerce, \ufb01rst as senior\nprofessional assistant for the mines and quarries division of the census bureau. She\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSPENCER - 2\n\nthen held various positions such as statistician, senior statistician, senior economic\nanalyst, and assistant to the chief of the minerals section before becoming chief of\nthe minerals section in July 1948. From 1950 to 1952 she directed the statistical\nsta\ufb00 for the President\u2019s Materials Policy Commission and in 1964 became special\nassistant for raw materials and production indexes.\n\nIn 1969 Spencer moved from the Bureau of the Census to the US Department\nof the Interior\u2019s Bureau of Mines to become chief of the commodity sta\ufb00. She re-\nmained in this position until her retirement in 1971. From 1957 to 1965 Spencer\nwas a professorial lecturer in statistics at American University and from 1973 was\nan adjunct professor in the mathematics department of the University of Connecti-\ncut, where her sister taught. Through the 1970s she continued to be listed as a\nstatistician at the Bureau of Mines in the Combined Membership List of the AMS,\nMAA, and SIAM. She also served as a consultant to the census bureau in 1972 and\n1977\u201378.\n\nIn the mid-1930s Vivian Spencer reported to the University of Pennsylvania\nplacement o\ufb03ce that she played violin and piano and that she read English, Latin,\nGerman, French, and Italian. In 1933 she listed her religious preference as Presby-\nterian.\n\nAfter her retirement from the government Spencer maintained her home in Wash-\nington, D.C. She also had a home in Boston, where her sister lived. She was seventy-\ntwo years old when she died suddenly in 1980 in her Boston home from sepsis.\nServices were held at St. Paul\u2019s Church (Episcopal) in Brookline.

Her mother was born in\nNorway and her father in Wisconsin of German parents. Mauch grew up in the\neast central area of South Dakota near De Smet. At the time of the 1900 census the\nfamily was living in Lake Preston, her parents had been married four years, and her\nfather\u2019s occupation was listed as harness maker. A younger sister, Ruby Henrietta,\nwas born in 1899. By 1910 Henry Mauch, now a banker, had been remarried for three\nyears, and the family was living in Hetland. In much of the second decade of the\ncentury, Henry Mauch was secretary-treasurer of the Arlington-Hetland Telephone\nCompany. By 1930 he was bank president. There were two sons from the second\nmarriage: Ralph, born in 1909, and Harold, born two years later.\n\nMargaret Mauch attended elementary and secondary public schools in South\nDakota. She studied at Huron College (now closed) in Huron, about thirty miles\nfrom De Smet. After receiving her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1919, she taught for a year\nat the Winner, South Dakota, high school in the south central part of the state\nand then was principal of the Edgerton high school in Minnesota for a year. The\nnext two years, 1921\u201323, Mauch attended the University of Chicago where she\nwas secretary-treasurer of the Junior Mathematical Club 1922\u201323.

July 18, 1905\u2013September 30, 1992.\nUniversity of Minnesota (BA 1927, MA 1930, PhD 1933).\n\nMarian Augusta Wilder, born in Shakopee, Minnesota, just southwest of Minneapolis,\nwas the daughter of Minnie Florence (Buchanan) (b. 1870) and George D. Wilder (b.\n1866), both natives of Minnesota. At the time of the 1900 census her parents had been\nmarried a year, her father was a sash and door commercial traveler, and they had an\ninfant daughter, Lois. In 1910 the family was living in St. Paul, her father was a salesman,\nand there were two surviving children, Lois and Marian, of three born. They were living\nin Minneapolis in 1920 and 1930.\n\nAll of Marian Wilder\u2019s university work was done at the University of Minnesota, where\nshe earned her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1927, her master\u2019s degree in 1930, and her doctorate\nin 1933. After she received her BA, Wilder was a high school teacher in Minnesota for\nthe next two years, 1927\u201329. She returned to the university in 1929, where she was an\nassistant in mathematics 1929\u201331 and an assistant in biometry 1931\u201334. Wilder worked\nwith the noted biometrician and botanist J. Arthur Harris, who headed the Minnesota\nbotany department from 1924 until his death in 1930; she published three papers with\nhim. Wilder received her master\u2019s degree in 1930 with a major in mathematics and a\nminor in education; her thesis dealt with the mathematical theory of statistics. She then\ncompleted her doctoral work with a major in mathematics and a minor in biometry. She\nremained at the university as a graduate fellow in the biometric laboratory 1933\u201334, the\nyear after she received her PhD.\n\nWilder worked as a statistician at the Mayo Clinic 1934\u201335 and then returned to the\nUniversity of Minnesota, where she was hired as a research statistician and instructor for\n1935\u201336. She wrote in her 1937 questionnaire for Helen Owens that she had \u201cbeen patient\nin sanitarium since Nov 1935 ready to begin work again Jan 1938.\u201d She is likely to have\nbeen at the Glen Lake state tuberculosis sanitarium, which was located in Oak Terrace,\nMinneapolis, her address on the September 1936 AMS membership list. She was a research\nstatistician for the committee on educational research in the college of education in the\nlate 1930s.\n\nWilder was a statistician with the division of preventable diseases of the Minnesota\nState Department of Health from 1938 or 1939 until 1942. Her work in the late 1930s and\nearly 1940s focused on the use of statistics in medical and psychological data.\n\nOn August 27, 1938, Marian Wilder married G. Parnell (Barney) Thornton (1907\u2013\n1968). They remained in the Minneapolis\u2013St. Paul area. Her address on membership lists\nfrom ASA and IMS show her living in St. Paul from about 1943. In February 1954,\nwhen she applied for her social security number, she was living in St. Paul and was\na substitute at the College of St. Catherine College in St. Paul. Later Thornton again\nworked for the University of Minnesota in Minneapolis. In 1966 her name appears on a\nlist of graduate faculty in the Biometry Division of the School of Public Health, College\nof Medical Sciences. In 1970\u201371 she was listed in the CML, the combined membership list\nof mathematics societies, as living in Minneapolis and as being an associate professor at\nthe university; she does not appear in subsequent lists.\n\nThornton was living in St. Louis Park, Minnesota, just west of Minneapolis, at the\ntime of her death at eighty-\ufb01ve in September 1992.

May 3, 1893\u2013June 4, 1990.\nWellesley College (BA 1916), Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MS\n1923, PhD 1930), Simmons College (MS 1925).\n\nDorothy Walcott Weeks was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the second of three\nchildren of Mary (Walcott) (ca. 1869\u20131932) and Edward Mitchell Weeks (1866\u20131959) who\nmarried in 1889. Her mother was born in New York and graduated from the Girls\u2019 High\nand Normal School (now Philadelphia High School for Girls), a secondary school, in 1887.\nHer father was born in New Jersey and studied art in Philadelphia and at the Corcoran Art\nSchool in Washington, D.C. Later he was a law student at George Washington University,\nreceived an LLB in 1907, and practiced patent law for a time. Primarily, however, he\nworked as an engraver, \ufb01rst for private companies and then for the US Bureau of Printing\nand Engraving.\n\nHer brother, Robert Walcott Weeks (1890\u20131964), was born in New York City and\nreceived a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1913 and a master\u2019s degree in 1914 from the Massachusetts\nInstitute of Technology. Both Dorothy Walcott Weeks and her sister, Ruth Walcott Weeks\n(b. ca. 1897), ful\ufb01lled a longstanding dream of their parents that if they ever had a\ndaughter she would go to Wellesley. Ruth Weeks, who was described as musical by her\nsister, graduated from Wellesley in 1919, three years after her older sister.\n\nThe Weeks family moved from Cheltenham, Pennsylvania, to Washington, D.C., in\n1900. Dorothy Weeks attended public schools there and graduated from Western High\nSchool, where her freshman and sophomore mathematics teacher, Nannie J. McKnight,\nwas a Wellesley graduate who had been in the same class as Helen Merrill. Weeks credited\nMcKnight with stimulating her interest in science and mathematics and enrolled at Welles-\nley College with the intention of studying those subjects. She graduated in 1916 with a\nmathematics major, having taken all the courses in physics, mathematics, and chemistry\nthat were o\ufb00ered, including three full-year mathematics courses from Helen Merrill and\ntwo full-year physics courses from Louise Sherwood McDowell, her mentor and later clos-\nest friend. While there she was also a member of the Shakespeare Society and continued\nher interest by attending meetings of the society when she lived in the Boston area in\nthe 1920s. It was through the Shakespeare Society that Weeks had informal contact with\nmany faculty members including Ellen Fitz Pendleton, president of the college and former\nmember of the mathematics department, and Louise McDowell.\n\nUntil she graduated from college, Weeks had intended to teach high school mathematics.\nShe wrote in her unpublished memoir \u201cFun on the Fringes\u201d: \u201cI was shocked to hear that\na classmate who had \ufb02unked Mathematics in college was to teach that subject in a high\nschool! I realized then that this kind of position would not interest me. Financially it\nwas out of the question for me to do graduate work. There were few assistantships and\nfellowships available at that time\u201d (p. 501). She reported that women were then not\nbeing hired by the National Bureau of Standards so she decided to become an assistant\nexaminer in the US Patent O\ufb03ce in Washington, D.C. There were six examinations to\npass: mathematics, physics, chemistry, scienti\ufb01c French or German, mechanical drawing,\nand \u201ctechnics.\u201d She later wrote that \u201cbefore I passed these examinations and received\nan appointment to the U. S. Patent O\ufb03ce, I registered as a substitute teacher in the\nhigh schools of Washington. . . . The principal of Fairmount Seminary . . . was in need of\nsomeone that fall of 1916 to teach most of the liberal arts courses\u201d (\u201cFun on the Fringes,\u201d\n503). She was hired to teach eight classes, six of which had only one or two students:\nchemistry, two algebra courses, plane geometry, beginning Latin, and Cicero and Horace.\nShe also taught two classes of rhetoric with six and twelve students, one of whom was the\nactress Tallulah Bankhead. Weeks described her as \u201cthe most outstanding student I had,\nnot necessarily academically\u201d (\u201cFun on the Fringes,\u201d 504).\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWEEKS - 2\n\nIn spring 1917, still having trouble scoring high enough on the mechanical drawing and\n\u201ctechnics\u201d examinations, Weeks was a statistical clerk with the O\ufb03ce of Farm Management\nin the Department of Agriculture. She passed the patent o\ufb03ce exams on her fourth try\n(the average number of attempts before passing was \ufb01ve) and in August 1917 joined one\nother woman among the four hundred examiners. She was the third woman to have been\nappointed a patent examiner, one having already retired. She also recalled that one did\nnot have to wait as long as earlier since men were being drafted for World War I. She\ncontinued, \u201cThis is one thing that I\u2019ve always resented, that my opportunities have come\nthrough wars, which is no way for women to get their opportunities\u201d (Sopka interview, 6).\nIn order to qualify for a promotion, which she received, Weeks studied Substantive\nPatent Law at George Washington University for a year in the evenings. In March 1918\nshe applied to Cornell University to study physics and chemistry and was admitted. In July\nof that year she was admitted to candidacy for an MA degree with experimental physics\nas her major subject and theoretical physics as her minor subject. She studied at Cornell\nduring the summers of 1918 and 1919. On October 13, 1919, Weeks wrote to the dean of\nthe Graduate School at Cornell that she had \u201cregistered at George Washington University\nfor an M.S. degree\u201d in physics and wanted her work at Cornell to be counted. However,\nit appears that she never attended classes at George Washington. In 1920 she worked for\nthe National Bureau of Standards, accepting a lower salary but attending classes given\nthere by the physics faculty of the Johns Hopkins University. She returned to the Patent\nO\ufb03ce in June 1920.\n\nDuring the summer of 1920, Edwin Wilson, the head of the physics department at MIT,\nwrote to the heads of physics departments at several women\u2019s colleges, including Louise\nMcDowell at Wellesley, seeking to hire assistants. In September 1920 Weeks joined the\ninstructional sta\ufb00 of the physics laboratory at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology\nas a laboratory assistant in the electrical laboratory; in 1922 she was made an instructor.\nShe also studied while working at MIT and received her MS in experimental physics in\nJune 1923. She chose the subject of her master\u2019s thesis because she was assisting Newell\nC. Page in his work with x-rays. After receiving her degree she taught college prepara-\ntory courses in physics part time at the Buckingham School in Cambridge, Massachusetts,\nwhile retaining her instructorship at MIT. In January 1923 Samuel Stratton became pres-\nident of MIT. Stratton had been director of the National Bureau of Standards and only\nallowed women employees there when forced to during World War I. That spring Weeks\nbegan considering leaving MIT. In November 1923 she wrote to Cornell University to\n\ufb01nd out how much credit she could receive towards a PhD. She learned that no summer\nwork would count toward residency and that her MIT work would not be evaluated until\nafter she had registered; she did not return to Cornell. Instead, she attended the Prince\nSchool of Retailing at Simmons College 1924\u201325 while working at Filene\u2019s and became\na supervisor for women at the Jordan Marsh department store in Boston in 1925 while\nstill studying. She received a master\u2019s degree from Simmons in 1925. She became hiring\nsupervisor at Jordan Marsh and remained in that position until September 1927. She then\nheld a temporary position doing statistical work for a researcher at the Harvard Medical\nSchool.\n\nIn February 1928 Weeks returned to MIT for graduate work. She was also a three-\nquarter-time instructor of physics at Wellesley College 1928\u201329. During the summer of\n1929 she taught mathematics at her alma mater, Western High School. Although she was\no\ufb00ered a position teaching physics in a women\u2019s college in India, she decided to remain a\nstudent at MIT and in 1929\u201330 held a Horton-Hallowell fellowship given by the Wellesley\nalumnae association. Courses in theoretical physics, by then her real interest, were o\ufb00ered\nin the mathematics department. Her dissertation advisor was Norbert Weiner, but she also\nworked with D. J. Struik in connection with the matrices developed in her dissertation,\nwhich she described as both physical and mathematical. She received her PhD in 1930.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWEEKS - 3\n\nDuring the summer of 1930 she worked in Washington, D.C., as an expert technical advisor\nto the US Civil Service Commission.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD, Weeks went to Wilson College, a women\u2019s college in Cham-\nbersburg, Pennsylvania, to develop the physics department and serve as the professor\nand head. It was only ninety miles from Washington, and early in her \ufb01rst years at Wil-\nson she frequently drove home to see her family, especially the \ufb01rst two years when her\nmother was ill. The summer after her \ufb01rst year at Wilson she taught mathematics and\nchemistry at Central High School in Washington. She spent the summer of 1932 doing\nresearch in Cambridge, England. That summer she attended the International Congress of\nMathematicians in Zurich and the International Federation of University Women conven-\ntion in Edinburgh. She traveled to Europe with Louise McDowell in the summer of 1934\nand returned to Cambridge for several weeks that summer. The following summer she\nreturned to MIT and began a research program in atomic spectroscopy. She was not the\nonly woman who was involved with spectroscopy. In fact, the abstract of Weeks\u2019s papers\nat MIT that appears in WorldCat notes that her papers \u201cinclude material concerning the\nMIT \u2018Charm School\u2019, the women who gathered together during summer terms to work . . .\nin the spectroscopy lab.\u201d\n\nWeeks had become fascinated with spectroscopy several years earlier and thought it was\na subject that could be understood by her undergraduate students at Wilson. She later\nexplained that it was through Louise McDowell at Wellesley that she \u201cbecame aware of the\nneed for continuing growth of the faculty if students were to receive an enriched education.\nIt was therefore necessary for [her] . . . to continue research, in a \ufb01eld not only interesting\nto [her] but also readily understood by undergraduates\u201d (1974, 32). Her research was\nsupported by a grant from the American Academy of Arts and Sciences when she spent\nthe \ufb01rst semester 1937\u201338 at MIT. Through 1950, except for the war years, she returned to\nwork in MIT\u2019s spectroscopy laboratory during her vacations and while on sabbatical. This\nresearch led to a 1944 paper in the Transactions of the American Philosophical Society.\n\nDuring World War II, Weeks \ufb01rst taught electricity and mechanics for an engineering\nscience management war course at Wilson. From 1943 to 1945 she worked as a technical\naide in the liaison o\ufb03ce of the US O\ufb03ce of Scienti\ufb01c Research and Development (OSRD)\nsupervising the British reports section. After the war she returned to Wilson College\nas professor of physics and head of the department but continued her position with the\nOSRD on a part-time basis through the end of 1946. She was a Guggenheim fellow at\nMIT and at laboratories in England and northern Europe 1949\u201350 and was a consultant\nto the National Science Foundation 1953\u201356. In 1954 she served as secretary, and then vice\npresident, of the newly formed Central Pennsylvania Section of the American Association\nof Physics Teachers.\n\nWeeks retired from Wilson in 1956 and moved to Wellesley to live with Louise Mc-\nDowell (1876\u20131966), her former Wellesley physics teacher, mentor, and long-time friend.\nIn Massachusetts Weeks began an eight-year association as a physicist with the Ordnance\nMaterials Research O\ufb03ce of the Army Materials Research Agency at the Watertown Ar-\nsenal. She soon became their technical representative to the Committee on Radioactive\nShielding. From 1956 to 1962 she coordinated a project that developed shielding material\nfor use against nuclear weapons. In September 1964, two months after she was forced to\nretire from her position with the army, Weeks went to the Harvard College Observatory\nas a part-time spectroscopist as a member of the NASA-supported Solar Satellite Project.\nShe stayed there twelve years, until her \ufb01nal retirement in 1976 at age eight-three. In\n1966\u201371 she was also a physics lecturer at the Newton College of the Sacred Heart, where\nshe worked to set up an undergraduate physics major.\n\nDorothy Weeks and Louise McDowell had traveled together over the years, and they\npurchased a summer cabin in the White Mountains in Randolph, New Hampshire, in\n1946. Their last European trips together were to Paris in 1956 and to Helsinki in 1959.\nMcDowell required full-time care from late 1960 until her death in 1966. In 1961 Weeks\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWEEKS - 4\n\nbought McDowell\u2019s house in order to ensure that McDowell could remain there; Weeks\nsubsequently bequeathed the house to Wellesley College.\n\nIn 1973 Weeks spoke at a panel, \u201cChange and Continuity,\u201d when MIT commemorated\na century of granting degrees to women. That year she also wrote her memoir \u201csitting\nat the table desk that was Miss [Helen] Merrill\u2019s\u201d (\u201cFun on the Fringes,\u201d 405). It was\ndeposited at the American Institute of Physics, Center for History of Physics.\n\nInspired by Ellen Fitz Pendleton, Weeks was active in the AAUW throughout her career\nand received its achievement award in 1969. She joined the Washington Branch in 1916,\nwhen it was still called the Association of Collegiate Alumnae (ACA), and was its treasurer\n1918\u201320. Later she served as president of the Pennsylvania-Delaware Division 1938\u201340, as\na member of the fellowship awards committee 1944\u201353, as chairman of the international\ngrants committee 1946\u201353, as a member of the college faculty awards committee 1961\u201364\nand 1965\u201366, and as president of the Boston Branch 1963\u201367. She was also active in the\nInternational Federation of University Women and was a member of the relief committee\n1947\u201353 and the fellowship awards committee 1954\u201359. Just before retiring from Wilson\nCollege, she was president of the Central Pennsylvania Section of the American Association\nof Physics Teachers 1955\u201356, having previously been vice president. She was also a member\nof the board of corporators of the Woman\u2019s Medical College of Pennsylvania from 1946 to\n1955 and was a member of the Washington Philosophical Society. She was the Wellesley\nCollege reunion chairman several times before World War II and then again for her \ufb01ftieth\nand \ufb01fty-\ufb01fth reunions. In 1973 she wrote, \u201cNow I have been appointed reunion chairman\nfor life\u201d (\u201cFun on the Fringes,\u201d 1508).\n\nWeeks received honorary degrees from Regis College, MIT, and the Medical College of\nPhiladelphia. She was one of forty-\ufb01ve graduates to be interviewed on their college experi-\nence for a Wellesley centennial publication, Wellesley After-Images. On May 12, 1980, she\nwas interviewed for the Wellesley Oral History Project, which retains a tape recording of\nthat interview. Wellesley\u2019s alumnae association gave her its alumnae achievement award\nin 1983 to recognize \u201cher career as teacher, physicist and leader in women\u2019s education\u201d\n(Hartmann, \u201cThere are Diversity of Gifts\u201d).\n\nIn a letter written in October 1986 that appeared the following June under the heading\n\u201cWomen in physics,\u201d Weeks replied to a series of letters on that topic. She described\nherself as \u201ca retired woman physicist who this past May had her 93rd birthday. I retired\nwhen I was 83. I have just attended my 70th class reunion at Wellesley College.\u201d She\ndescribed her career and noted that \u201cthe responsibilities assigned me were independent of\nsex. Education, ability and personality are the important factors that should be considered\nwhen a person is appointed to a position\u201d (Physics Today 40 (6): 15).\n\nDorothy W. Weeks had been living in Wellesley before she died, following a stroke,\nat the Newton-Wellesley Hospital in Newton, Massachusetts, at age ninety-seven in 1990.\nShe was survived by her sister. A memorial service was held at St. Andrew\u2019s Episcopal\nChurch in Wellesley.\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, Amer. Assoc. of Phys. Teachers, Amer. Phys.

      "text": "SIMOND, Ruth G. March 7, 1904\u2013September 15, 1958.\nBoston University (BA 1927, MA 1929), University of Michigan (PhD 1938).\n\nRuth Gertrude Simond was the youngest of four surviving children, of \ufb01ve born,\nof Grace M. (Fi\ufb01eld) (1872\u20131967) and Walter A. Simond (1871\u20131962), both natives\nof New Hampshire who married in 1892. She was born in Franklin, New Hampshire.\nAccording to census records, in 1900 her father was a knitter of hosiery (a common\noccupation in Franklin at that time); he was described in 1910 as foreman of a\nhosiery mill, in 1920 as a draftsman in a machine shop, and in 1930 as a machinist\nin a hosiery mill. Her mother taught vocal and instrumental music. Her siblings\nwere Flora (1894\u20131954), Maurice (1898\u20131990), and Marion (1901-1997).\n\nSimond grew up in Franklin and presumably attended school there. She entered\nBoston University in 1923 and graduated in 1927. After receiving her bachelor\u2019s\ndegree, she entered the Boston University graduate school, where she took courses\nin astrophysics, physical chemistry, and celestial mechanics as well as topics in\nadvanced mathematics, curve tracing and graphical computation, the constructions\nof plane geometry, advanced calculus, and a survey of mathematics for teachers of\nelementary and secondary schools. It appears that she took one course in summer\n1927, one in 1927\u201328, and the rest in 1928\u201329. She received her master\u2019s degree in\nJune 1929 with a thesis on using graphic calculation in physical chemistry.\n\nSimond was employed for the next four years. She classi\ufb01ed mathematics books\nfor the Harvard library during 1929\u201330. The next year she was an instructor at\nHampton Institute (now Hampton University), one of the historically black colleges\nand universities in Virginia; it was called Hampton Normal and Agricultural Insti-\ntute until 1930. She was a teacher at the Gorham (Maine) Normal School 1931\u201332\nand returned to Hampton Institute as instructor for the school year 1932\u201333.\n\nRuth Simond began her graduate work at the University of Michigan in the\nsummer of 1933 and was registered for courses throughout the academic years and\nsummers until 1937. She was taking courses part time during the regular academic\nyears 1934\u201335 through 1936\u201337. Her dissertation was supervised by W. L. Ayres,\nand the PhD degree was awarded in February 1938. Simond was in charge of the\nmathematics courses in the correspondence study department of the University of\nMichigan extension service 1936\u201338. During this period, she was among those who\nprepared or revised materials for supervised correspondence courses under the aegis\nof the Michigan Works Progress Administration (WPA). In 1936 she and one of her\ncoauthors, Edith R. Schneckburger (PhD University of Michigan 1940), were the\ntwo nominees of the University of Michigan for membership in the AMS.\n\nAfter leaving Michigan in 1938, Simond returned to Hampton Institute, where\nshe was associate professor the next four years. She left in 1942, and a notation of\n\u201cU.S. Navy Dept.\u201d was a part of her 1942 AMS membership listing. From August\n1943 until March 1944, Simond taught in the Army Specialized Training Program\nat Heidelberg College in Ti\ufb03n, Ohio. During that year nearly 250 military men\nwere added to the regular civilian enrollment of approximately the same number\nat the college, although the army required that the military and civilians could\nnot be in the same classes. The 1944 AMS membership list has only an address in\nBaltimore for Simond. It is unclear exactly what Simond was doing during the two\nyears 1942\u201343 and 1944\u201345. According to her obituary Simond was a cryptanalyst\nfor the Navy Department in Washington during World War II, possibly during\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSIMOND - 2\n\n1942\u201343. Relatives indicate that she also worked as a \u201cGrey Lady\u201d or nurse\u2019s aide\nduring the war.\n\nFrom September 1945 to June 1947 Simond was assistant professor at Berea\nCollege in Kentucky. She was originally invited to Berea to teach mathematics to\nmembers of the Navy V-12 unit there. The following year she taught at Morningside\nCollege in Sioux City, Iowa. In 1948 she was appointed assistant professor at the\nUniversity of Vermont and State Agricultural College and remained in that position\nfor the next decade.\n\nSimond lived in Essex Junction, just outside Burlington, Vermont, and belonged\nto the Essex Junction Methodist Church. She taught through the spring semester\n1958 and died in Burlington of complications from diabetes on September 15, 1958,\nat \ufb01fty-four. She was survived by her two sisters and her brother.

      "text": "R\n\nRAGSDALE, Virginia. December 13, 1870\u2013June 4, 1945.\nGuilford College (BS 1892), Bryn Mawr College (BA 1896, PhD 1904).\n\nVirginia Ragsdale\u2019s parents, Emily Jane (Idol) (1841\u20131934) and Joseph Sinclair\nRagsdale (1836\u20131903), natives of North Carolina, met and were married in 1866,\nafter Joseph Ragsdale\u2019s return from \ufb01ghting in the Civil War. There were four\nchildren of the marriage: Lula May, born in May 1867 and died in July 1867;\n(Julia) Ida (1868\u20131911); Virginia; and William Gannaway (1874\u20131929). Before her\nmarriage Ragsdale\u2019s mother had attended various boarding schools and seminaries\nin Davidson County, North Carolina, and had taught in county public schools.\nVirginia Ragsdale was born in Jamestown, North Carolina, and her father, who\nowned and taught in a small private school early in his career, became a cotton\nmanufacturer there and a prominent business man in the state.\n\nVirginia Ragsdale \ufb01rst attended the private Flint Hill School in Jamestown.\nOther early education was obtained at the high school in Jamestown, at the Salem\nFemale Academy, and by private study. She entered the Salem Female Academy as a\njunior and graduated as valedictorian with an extra diploma in piano in 1887, three\nyears before the academy was renamed Salem College. In 1891 Ragsdale entered\nGuilford College in Greensboro, North Carolina, a coeducational institution that\nhad been founded by the Society of Friends in 1837 and was known as the New\nGarden Boarding School until 1889. She graduated after one year with the class of\n1892.\n\nUpon graduation Ragsdale became the \ufb01rst person to receive Bryn Mawr Col-\nlege\u2019s newly established scholarship of four hundred dollars for being the Guilford\nwoman with the highest scholastic average in her class. She spent the next \ufb01ve\nyears at Bryn Mawr, and, although listed on the commencement program for 1904\nas a graduate student in mathematics during that period, she actually studied for a\nsecond bachelor\u2019s degree that she received after four years in 1896. She completed\nher mathematics major by 1894 and then took post-major courses, that is, courses\nopen to graduate students and undergraduates who had completed the major. These\ncourses included the theory of functions, modern analytic geometry, and algebra.\nBefore 1896 Ragsdale also took both major and minor courses in physics, minor\ncourses in chemistry, and several German and Latin courses. She was elected Eu-\nropean fellow for the class of 1896. Rather than immediately taking the fellowship,\nRagsdale remained at Bryn Mawr for a year as both an assistant demonstrator in\nphysics and as a graduate student in mathematics, taking post-major courses in\nhigher plane curves and the theory of substitutions and auditing classes in German\nliterature and Italian art. During that year, 1896\u201397, Ragsdale also participated\nin the newly formed Mathematical Journal Club, which met every other week to\n\u201creceive reports on special topics and listen to outline accounts of interesting theo-\nries that do not naturally present themselves in the regular graduate work\u201d (Bryn\nMawr College, President\u2019s Report to the Board of Trustees 1896\u201397). In addition\nto the Bryn Mawr faculty and graduate students, both Frank Morley and E. W.\nBrown of Haverford presented papers at the journal club.\n\nIn March 1897 Charlotte Scott wrote to Felix Klein that she was \u201cexpecting to\nsend two of [her] best students to G\u00a8ottingen next year\u201d (Felix Klein Nachlass XI,\nUniversit\u00a8atsarchiv G\u00a8ottingen, Nieders\u00a8achische Staats- und Universit\u00a8atsbibliothek).\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nRAGSDALE - 2\n\nScott was referring to Ragsdale and Emilie Martin, an 1894 Bryn Mawr graduate\nin mathematics who also continued as a graduate student and who had also been\nawarded a fellowship to study in Europe. Ragsdale spent the year 1897\u201398 studying\nwith Felix Klein and David Hilbert at the university in G\u00a8ottingen. Both Ragsdale\nand Martin attended Klein\u2019s lectures on \u201cMechanik.\u201d When she returned from\nGermany Ragsdale did not immediately return to her formal graduate studies.\nRather, she taught mathematics and science at the Bryn Mawr School in Baltimore\nfor three years. It was not until she received in 1901 a fellowship awarded by the\nBaltimore Association for the Promotion of University Education of Women that\nRagsdale returned to her studies. She studied at Bryn Mawr College 1901\u201303 and\nheld the resident fellowship in mathematics in 1902\u201303. Ragsdale spoke to the Bryn\nMawr journal club in December 1901 on the topic in algebraic geometry of her\ndissertation, which was directed by Charlotte A. Scott. She passed her examination\nfor the PhD in September 1903, presenting as her major subject pure mathematics\nand as her minor subjects, physics and applied mathematics. Ragsdale\u2019s fellowships\nto Bryn Mawr ended in 1903, and she returned to teaching, this time in New York\nCity at Dr. Sachs\u2019 School for Girls.\n\nRagsdale\u2019s PhD was conferred at the 1904 commencement. Her dissertation was\nnot published until 1906, and this later date often appears as the date of her degree,\nincluding on Bryn Mawr College registers of alumnae. However, according to the\nsecretary to the president of Bryn Mawr writing to Helen Owens in May 1936,\n\u201cthe dates of publication of the Bryn Mawr PhD Theses . . . do not correspond in\nany regular way with the dates of conferring the degrees. Our general rule about\npublication is that the dissertation must be published within three years of the\nconferring of the degree\u201d (Owens Papers).\n\nIn her dissertation Ragsdale proved that if all smooth sixth degree curves that\nhave the maximum number of components arise in one of two ways, then certain\nrestriction must hold on the number of ovals that can lie inside other ovals. What\nhas become known as the \u201cRagsdale Conjecture\u201d is that those restrictions always\nhold. This conjecture, never explicitly made by Ragsdale, is a generalization of the\nassertion David Hilbert made in 1891 that a smooth sixth degree curve that has a\nmaximum number of components has at least one oval that is internal to another\noval. The Ragsdale Conjecture was proved to be incorrect in 1979 by Oleg Viro and\nmuch has been written on it since then, including a 1996 expository article by Viro\nand Ilia Itenberg. Articles have continued to appear that address the characteristics\nof counterexamples to the conjecture.\n\nRagsdale continued to teach at Dr. Sachs\u2019 School for Girls until 1905 and then\nwas at her home in North Carolina the following year. She resumed teaching and\nwas head of the department of mathematics at the Baldwin School in Bryn Mawr\n1906\u201311. During this time she maintained her connections with Bryn Mawr College;\nshe spoke in the journal club, and from 1908 to 1910 she assisted Scott as a reader.\nAfter the death of her sister in 1911, Ragsdale moved back to North Carolina to\ntake a position at the State Normal and Industrial College in Greensboro, chartered\ntwenty years earlier as the \ufb01rst state-supported school for the higher education of\nwomen in North Carolina. It was renamed North Carolina College for Women in\n1919 and is now the University of North Carolina at Greensboro. During the years\n1911 through 1926 she was instructor, associate professor, and then professor, and\nwas head of the department from 1926 until 1928. She had taken a leave of absence\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nRAGSDALE - 3\n\nduring the academic years 1913\u201314 and 1914\u201315, and spent most of that \ufb01rst year\nat the Highlands Camp Sanatorium, with a lung lesion, later determined not to be\ntubercular. In 1928, when she was not yet \ufb01fty-eight, Ragsdale retired to be with\nher mother and help manage a family farm. Helen Barton had joined the faculty at\nthe college the previous year.\n\nAfter her mother\u2019s death in 1934, Ragsdale had a house built on the Guilford\nCollege campus and became part of the Guilford community. She was a member of\nthe executive committee of the Guilford College Alumni Association, belonged to\nthe Friday Afternoon Book Club and the college Art Appreciation Club, and was\na member of the Society of Friends at New Garden Friends Meeting. She was an\navid and skilled gardener and was a devoted and much loved aunt to her thirteen\nsurviving nieces and nephews. She was interested in genealogy and submitted a\nquestion to the William and Mary Quarterly that was published in 1930.\n\nVirginia Ragsdale died at Wesley Long Hospital in Greensboro at age seventy-\nfour in 1945 after several months of declining health. Interment was in Deep River\nFriends Meeting Historic Cemetery in nearby High Point, North Carolina. Her house\nwas bequeathed to Guilford College and now stands as Ragsdale House, the home\nof the president of the college. In 1950 the Dr. Virginia Ragsdale Residence Hall\nwas built on the campus of the University of North Carolina at Greensboro.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA (charter member).\n\nDissertation:\n1904 On the arrangement of the real branches of plane algebraic curves.

      "text": "COHEN, Teresa. February 14, 1892\u2013August 10, 1992.\nGoucher College (BA 1912), Johns Hopkins University (MA 1915, PhD 1918).\n\nTeresa Cohen was born in Baltimore, Maryland, the daughter of Rebecca (Sin-\nsheimer) (b. 1856) and Benjamin Cohen (b. 1855), natives of Maryland. She was\nthe eldest of four children; her younger siblings were Simon (1894\u20131977), Martha\n(1896\u20131978), and Hilda (1898\u20132000). Her father was a wholesale shoe merchant.\n\nCohen graduated from Friends School in Baltimore in 1909 before entering\nGoucher College from which she graduated in 1912 as a member of Phi Beta Kappa.\nHer two sisters also graduated from Goucher; Martha became a social worker, and\nHilda became an attorney. Her brother, Simon, studied at the Johns Hopkins Uni-\nversity and received his bachelor\u2019s degree from the University of Cincinnati. He then\nwas ordained a rabbi by, and later received a Doctor of Divinity degree from, He-\nbrew Union College in Cincinnati; he spent most of his career engaged in academic\nwork.\n\nIn 1912 Teresa Cohen entered Johns Hopkins with a resident fellowship for the\nyear 1912\u201313. After she received her master\u2019s degree in 1915, she was made a\nuniversity scholar at Johns Hopkins for the year 1915\u201316 and was a fellow 1917\u201318.\nIn her dissertation she thanks not only her advisor, Frank Morley, but also A. B.\nCoble, Abraham Cohen, and two of her teachers at Goucher, Clara L. Bacon and\nFlorence P. Lewis. Her minor subjects were physical chemistry and chemistry.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD in 1918, Cohen went to the University of Illinois for the\nyear 1918\u201319 as an instructor. She also taught courses at Johns Hopkins during\nthe summers of 1918, 1919, and 1920. In the fall of 1920, the chairman of Pennsyl-\nvania State College (now University) found himself in need of another instructor\nand remembered that Abraham Cohen, Teresa Cohen\u2019s uncle and one of his for-\nmer teachers at Johns Hopkins, had mentioned that his niece was available for\nemployment. Thus, in September 1920 Teresa Cohen became the \ufb01rst woman on\nthe mathematics faculty at Penn State. She said in a 1979 interview, \u201cI used to\nstay out of the way and hope that if I wasn\u2019t a nuisance they\u2019d get some more\nwomen\u201d (Hale). Over the years a number of women joined Cohen and stayed at\nPenn State; these include Aline Huke Frink, Beatrice Hagen, and Helen Owens. In\nthe late 1930s, Owens, who was not yet on the faculty because she was the wife of the\nchairman of the department, formed the Committee for Study of Women\u2019s Work\nin Mathematics, for which Cohen served as chairman. That committee arranged\na luncheon honoring early American women mathematicians at the mathematics\nmeetings held in State College in September 1937. Also at those meetings, Cohen\nperformed a violin sonatina at a concert held one evening.\n\nCohen remained on the faculty of Penn State until she was forced to retire at age\nseventy. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1921, to associate professor in\n1938, and to professor in 1945. In 1956 the department published notes on \u201cBasic\nAlgebra and Trigonometry\u201d that she had written with two colleagues, Walter J.\nHarrington and Frank Kocher.\n\nAfter her retirement, Cohen held the title professor emeritus, taught some classes,\nand worked as an unpaid volunteer, tutoring students who had problems with math-\nematics. She continued to tutor on a regular basis for twenty-four years until a\nserious accident in early 1986 prevented her from doing so. A car lost its brakes\nand pinned her against her house causing her severe damage from which she never\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCOHEN - 2\n\ncompletely recovered. After several months in the hospital and in rehabilitation\nin Pennsylvania, her family moved her to a nursing home in Pikesville, Maryland,\nwhere she lived until her \ufb01nal illness.\n\nBoth before and after the accident, Cohen was recognized for her contributions\nto Penn State and its mathematics department. In November 1979, the alumni\nassociation of the Lion\u2019s Paw Senior Honor Society, a group that recognizes student\nleaders at Penn State, presented Cohen with its Lion\u2019s Paw Medal for extraordinary\nservice to the university. In 1982 the department created the Teresa Cohen Service\nAward, which is presented biannually on, or close to, Cohen\u2019s Valentine\u2019s Day\nbirthdate; the award is given to one faculty member at the main campus and another\nat one of the other campuses in the university system. After Cohen\u2019s accident, her\nniece and nephew contributed to the establishment in 1987 of the Teresa Cohen\nTutorial Endowment Fund in the mathematics department. In 1991, a year before\nCohen\u2019s death, the department established the Sperling-Cohen tutoring program\nfor \ufb01rst-year calculus that bears her name along with that of a 1936 alumnus who\ncontributed generously to the department\u2019s tutoring program. The head of the\ndepartment in 1992, Jerry Bona, said \u201cOne of her greatest gifts to us was that she\nshowed us what to do and how to do it. We are merely following her example\u201d\n(Ferguson 1992).\n\nCohen was active in Sigma Delta Epsilon (now Sigma Delta Epsilon/Graduate\nWomen in Science) and was national treasurer from 1954 until 1963, a year after her\nretirement from teaching. At the time of her retirement, the Sigma Delta Epsilon\nNews reported that \u201cone of her great loves is music and she goes to as many\nconcerts as she can. She plays the violin and continues to take lessons during summer\nvacations. She says, \u2018I am not much of a player, but I do have a lot of fun.\u2019 \u201d She\nstarted her violin lessons at age ten and continued them until age eighty-\ufb01ve.

May 14, 1899\u2013April 7, 1952.\nBryn Mawr College (BA 1920, MA 1922), University of Chicago (PhD 1934).\n\nMarie Paula Litzinger was born in Bedford, Pennsylvania, the eldest of \ufb01ve\nchildren of Katherine (O\u2019Connell) (1870\u20131948) and Rush C. Litzinger (1865\u20131927),\nboth natives of Pennsylvania. Her father worked for the Pennsylvania Railroad\nas clerk, bookkeeper, and accountant. When the railroad moved its o\ufb03ces out of\nBedford, he resigned his position and opened an insurance and real estate o\ufb03ce\nthere. The other children were Katherine (1902\u20131990), Margaret (b. ca. 1905), Rush\nC. Jr. (ca. 1906\u20131910), and Anna E. (b. ca. 1909).\n\nMarie Litzinger attended elementary and secondary school in Bedford and grad-\nuated from high school in 1916. She then attended Bryn Mawr College 1916\u201323,\nwhere she received both her bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees. While there she held\nseveral scholarships; she was the James E. Rhoads sophomore scholar 1917\u201318, the\n\ufb01rst Charles S. Hinchman memorial scholar 1918\u201319, and the Maria D. Eastman\nBrooke Hall memorial scholar and Anna M. Powers memorial scholar 1919\u201320. In\n1920 Marie Litzinger was awarded her BA in Latin and mathematics, magna cum\nlaude. She was awarded the Bryn Mawr European fellowship and the Shippen for-\neign scholarship 1920\u201321, but did not study abroad until 1923. She also taught in\nthe Devon Manor School in nearby Devon, Pennsylvania, during her two years as a\nmaster\u2019s student 1920\u201322. While at Bryn Mawr she studied with Olive C. Hazlett,\nAnna Pell Wheeler, and Charlotte A. Scott.\n\nLitzinger was awarded a mathematics resident fellowship of $810 for additional\ngraduate study at Bryn Mawr in 1922\u201323, the year after she received her master\u2019s\ndegree. In addition to other work, she gave one talk each semester in the Mathemat-\nical Journal Club at Bryn Mawr. During the year 1923\u201324 she went to Europe and\nattended courses by G. Castelnuovo, F. Enriques, and V. Volterra at the University\nof Rome. The following year she taught at the Greenwich Academy in Greenwich,\nConnecticut.\n\nLitzinger began her association with Mount Holyoke College in 1925. She was in-\nstructor 1925\u201328 and assistant professor 1928\u201337. During this period Marie Litzinger\u2019s\nsister Anna was a student at Mount Holyoke. Anna Litzinger graduated in 1931\nwith an honors paper in chemistry and received a master\u2019s degree in chemistry in\n1933. Her sister Margaret attended Drexel Institute of Art, Science, and Industry\nin Philadelphia in the late 1920s.\n\nDuring the years 1928 through 1934 Marie Litzinger was in residence for four\nquarters at the University of Chicago, one in autumn 1929 on a leave of absence from\nMount Holyoke. She wrote her PhD dissertation at Chicago under the direction of\nL. E. Dickson and received her doctorate in 1934. Her dissertation was published\nin the Transactions of the AMS the following year.\n\nIn 1937 Marie Litzinger was promoted to associate professor and was made chair-\nman of the department at Mount Holyoke. She remained department chairman and\nwas promoted to professor in 1942. She held a chair in mathematics from the John\nStewart Kennedy Foundation after 1948. While at Mount Holyoke, Litzinger no-\ntably strengthened the mathematics department. Among her college activities was\nwork on the academic committee, the space advisory committee, and the advisory\ncommittee on appointments, reappointments, and promotions. She was also active\nin the Connecticut Valley Colloquium, the Mount Holyoke chapter of the AAUP,\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLITZINGER - 2\n\nand the Connecticut Valley section of the Association of Teachers of Mathematics\nin New England, where she served as secretary 1936\u201338, vice president 1939\u201340,\npresident elect 1940\u201341, and then president. In 1942 she and B. H. Brown of Dart-\nmouth prepared the questions for the \ufb01fth Putnam Competition. Litzinger joined\nthe AMS shortly after she went to Mount Holyoke and almost immediately started\nattending meetings of the society. From 1934 through 1949, with the exception of\none year, she attended at least one, and usually several, meetings a year; most were\nin New York City. Litzinger\u2019s entry in Who Was Who in America (1951\u20131960)\nindicates that she was a Democrat.\n\nLitzinger traveled in France and Italy in the summer of 1951. She was forced\nby illness to take a leave of absence from the college in November that year. At\nthat time she returned to Bedford, Pennsylvania, where her sister Katherine was\na high school teacher. Marie Litzinger died several months later at age \ufb01fty-two.\nHer three sisters survived her. In a tribute after her death, Alzada Comstock, an\neconomics colleague, recalled Litzinger\u2019s delicate humor, imaginative outlook, time\nfor undergraduates, devotion to her family, and loyalty.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, AAUP, Sigma Xi.\n\nDissertation:\n1934 A basis for residual polynomials in n variables.

In 1969, when\nSister Mary Charlotte\u2019s tenure as president ended, the college in Louisville merged\nwith the one in Nazareth, became coeducational, and adopted the name Spalding\nCollege (now Spalding University).\n\nFowler is credited with many positive changes and innovations while president\nof the college. These included overseeing a period of growth of about \ufb01fty percent\nin the student population and conducting the \ufb01rst capital campaign in the college\u2019s\nhistory. Graduate programs were added, and science, library, and dormitory build-\nings were constructed. The Fowler Fellowships, which allowed anyone sixty-\ufb01ve or\nolder to take classes tuition-free, were created as was the Center for Continuing\nEducation for the non-traditional student.\n\nSister Mary Charlotte was active in the community and was inducted into the\nHonorable Order of the Kentucky Colonels in 1967. She was a member of the\nKentucky Academy of Science. In 1992 she described her political a\ufb03liation as\nDemocrat. Among hobbies she enjoyed were reading, crafts, photography, stamp\ncollecting, collection of unusual recipes, and weaving, which continued well into\nher retirement. She also was a member of the American Association of Physics\nTeachers.\n\nIn the early 1970s, she was living in St. Vincent\u2019s Home, an orphanage for boys,\nin Roanoke, Virginia. At some point, after the orphanage disbanded in 1975, she\nwas living at the Motherhouse in Nazareth, Kentucky. Sister Mary Charlotte died\non her ninety-eighth birthday in the Nazareth Home in Louisville, Kentucky, in\n1997. She was survived by three sisters and a half-sister, and she was buried in the\nNazareth Motherhouse Cemetery.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, NCTM.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1935 Certain of the metric properties of conic sections and their projective bases.

      "text": "BALLARD, Ruth (Mason). April 24, 1906\u2013June 7, 1980.\nWellesley College (BA 1926), University of Chicago (MS 1928, PhD 1932).\n\nRuth Glidden Mason was born in Chicago, Illinois, the younger of two children of\nBertha Hall (Sickles) (1866\u20131937) and Fred Bonfoy Mason (1870\u20131932). Her mother\nwas in one of the earliest classes, possibly the \ufb01rst, at Michael Reese Hospital\nSchool of Nursing in Chicago. Her father was an 1890 graduate of Oberlin College\nand became an insurance agent in Chicago. They married in 1902, and their son,\nIra Jenckes, was born in 1904. He attended Yale University and the University of\nMichigan and died in 1992.\n\nRuth Mason attended the Knickerbocker grammar school and Robert Waller\nHigh School, both public schools in Chicago. After her high school graduation at\nage sixteen, she studied one year at the University of Chicago before completing\nher undergraduate work in 1926 after three years at Wellesley College.\n\nMason immediately entered the University of Chicago where, after graduate\nstudy during the academic year 1926\u201327 and the spring and summer quarters of\n1928, she received her master\u2019s degree in 1928. She wrote her thesis under the\ndirection of Mayme Irwin Logsdon. During 1930\u201331 she was both a Horton-Hallowell\nfellow (from Wellesley) and a graduate fellow at Chicago. She studied one semester\nwith D. N. Lehmer at the University of California in 1930 before \ufb01nishing the work\nfor her PhD at Chicago in 1932.\n\nWhen Mason joined the MAA in 1932 she indicated that she was doing private\nresearch in Berkeley. She remained in the area doing some postdoctoral work at the\nUniversity of California, Berkeley, in the years 1932\u201334 and taught at the College\nof the Holy Names (now Holy Names University) in Oakland, California, in 1933.\nDuring this period she gave her \ufb01rst talks on women in mathematics: in June 1933\nto the Junior Mathematics Club at the University of Chicago and in November\n1934 to Pi Mu Epsilon at the University of California, Berkeley. In a letter to Helen\nOwens of August 11, 1937, Mason wrote that \u201ca few years ago while preparing a\npaper on Women in Mathematics, I realized that the really interesting part of their\nhistory is that of the progress of recent decades. Before that time a trained aptitude\nin mathematics was enough to make a woman a conspicuous and historical freak.\nNow even our maiden aunts merely think that mathematics is a somewhat odd \ufb01eld\nfor a woman to work in\u201d (Owens Papers).\n\nRuth Mason returned to the East and taught at Wellesley in the spring semester\nof 1935. Then she was an instructor at Hood College in Frederick, Maryland, 1935\u2013\n36 before moving back to Illinois where, except for travel, she remained. She taught\nat the University of Illinois in Urbana 1936\u201338, as assistant the \ufb01rst year and\ninstructor the second. She made a trip to Europe in summer 1938 and joined the\nfaculty at Wright Junior College in Chicago that fall; she remained at Wright for\n\ufb01ve years. She was chairman of the mathematics section of the Illinois Association\nof Junior Colleges 1939\u201340. That same year she served as secretary-treasurer of\nthe Chicago Mathematical Model Club and demonstrated materials for freshman\nmathematics that had been made under the auspices of the WPA.\n\nOn April 20, 1940, Ruth Mason married Foster K. Ballard (1899\u20131978), a grad-\nuate of the University of Chicago, chemist for the US Customs Service, and a long-\ntime friend of her brother. At about this time Ruth Mason Ballard was appointed\nto the newly formed MAA Committee on Section Meetings; she remained on the\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBALLARD - 2\n\ncommittee until 1947. She remained at Wright only until 1943, when circumstances\nrequired a change. Her holiday letter of 1943 describes the situation.\n\nUntil last June there were no radical changes in our way of life. . . .\nEnrollment was falling o\ufb00 at Wright \u2013 Boys were leaving for the\narmed forces, and girls for jobs. There had once been seven faculty\nmembers in our department; by last June there were \ufb01ve. Then\non the morning of the \ufb01rst day of \ufb01nal examinations came the\norder that because the Navy was taking over the building, the\nWright Junior College faculty were to be out by \ufb01ve-thirty that\nevening. . . . The students took \ufb01nal examinations while the rooms\nwere being dismantled around their heads. We \ufb01nished the semester\nat Herzl, . . . a Junior College on the west side of Chicago. (letter\nprovided to author by Fred E. Ballard)\n\nWright College was saved, although the enrollment dropped from about three\nthousand a few years earlier to about six hundred. Ballard was on leave of absence,\nbut was teaching again in July 1943, this time in a Navy V-12 program for sailors,\nhoused at the Illinois Institute of Technology in Chicago. She continued teaching\nin this program until 1945.\n\nThe Ballards\u2019 son, Fred Everett, was born on May 26, 1946. For the next few\nyears Ruth Ballard\u2019s activities focused on playground groups, Cub Scouts, and\nPTA, while she continued to teach Sunday school in the Episcopal church and\nserve as a choir mother and member of the vestry. Throughout her life she enjoyed\ntravel in the United States and cultural activities in Chicago: theater, museums,\nand opera. She was interested in mathematical puzzles and had some original ones\npublished. She also maintained her involvement with the Women\u2019s Mathematics\nClub of Chicago and Vicinity.\n\nFrom 1955 until her retirement in 1972, Ballard taught full time as assistant\nprofessor and then associate professor at the University of Illinois at Navy Pier\n(moved and renamed the University of Illinois at Chicago Circle in 1965, now the\nUniversity of Illinois at Chicago). During this period she was program director in\n1962\u201363 and president in 1963\u201364 of the Women\u2019s Mathematics Club. She also\nproduced notes for an elementary college geometry course that were copyrighted in\n1971.\n\nRuth Ballard died at seventy-four in 1980 at Rush-Presbyterian-St. Luke\u2019s Hos-\npital in Chicago. The funeral was held in St. Augustine\u2019s Episcopal Church in\nWilmette.

December 30, 1910\u2013August 29, 1994.\nHunter College (BA 1929), Bryn Mawr College (MA 1930, PhD 1937).\n\nAnnita Tuller was the daughter of Ida (Bick) (1883\u20131931) and Morris Tuller (1886\u2013\n1934), natives of Russia who were likely Jewish. Her mother had attended religious school\nand her father the equivalent of high school before they came to the United States in 1908.\nHer parents married in November 1909, Annita was born a year later in Brooklyn, New\nYork, and a brother, Theodore, was born in 1916. Her mother was a housewife, her father\nwas a jeweler, and her brother later became a physician.\n\nAnnita Tuller received her primary and secondary education in the public schools of\nBrooklyn. She graduated from Erasmus Hall High School in 1925 at age fourteen and en-\ntered Hunter College that same year. In 1985 Tuller recalled from her Hunter experience\nthat Carolyn Eisele, her freshman mathematics teacher, \u201cinspired me, as an undergrad-\nuate, to change my major from French to Math,\u201d and the \u201clectures [of Louis Weisner]\non Non-Euclidean Geometry focussed my interest in geometries\u201d (Smithsonian question-\nnaire). In her dissertation vita, she thanked Lao G. Simons of Hunter \u201cwho suggested I\ndo graduate work in math.\u201d\n\nIn the fall of 1929, after her graduation from Hunter, Tuller entered, as a graduate\nscholar, Bryn Mawr College, where her \ufb01rst graduate school instructor was Anna Pell\nWheeler, whom she described as \u201ca role model for me, [who] inspired me to go on to\nthe Ph.D.\u201d (Smithsonian questionnaire). After earning her master\u2019s degree at the end\nof the academic year 1929\u201330, she returned to Hunter, at age nineteen, as a substitute\ninstructor in mathematics for a year. From 1931 to 1935 she was a mathematics and\nphysics teacher at William Cullen Bryant High School in Long Island City, Queens, New\nYork. She returned to Bryn Mawr, as a resident fellow 1935\u201336 and as a graduate scholar\n1936\u201337. She completed her work for the PhD with a dissertation in di\ufb00erential geometry\nwritten under the direction of Gustav A. Hedlund, whom she later indicated, \u201cencouraged\nme all the way\u201d (Smithsonian questionnaire).\n\nTuller became a tutor at Hunter College in the fall of 1937, just after she received\nher Bryn Mawr PhD. She was in Europe in the summer of 1938. On November 23, 1938,\nshe married Morris Levine (1912\u20131983) of Brooklyn, who worked for, and later became\ncirculation manager for, a newspaper publishing \ufb01rm in New York. The Levines had two\ndaughters, Judith, born in 1942, and Diane, born in 1944. Judith graduated from the\nUniversity of Southern California and did graduate work later. Diane graduated from\nSwarthmore College and earned a PhD from Columbia University in 1973 in language and\nmodern literature.\n\nAnnita Tuller, who continued to use her maiden name professionally, remained on the\nfaculty at Hunter College: as tutor 1937\u201339, instructor 1939\u201349, assistant professor 1949\u2013\n61, and associate professor 1961\u201368. She was teaching at the Bronx campus of Hunter\nwhen it became an independent college, Herbert H. Lehman College (CUNY), in 1968.\nShe then taught at Lehman as professor and retired as professor emeritus on February 1,\n1971.\n\nDuring her career at Hunter and at Lehman, Tuller taught a variety of undergradu-\nate courses as well as graduate courses in non-Euclidean geometry, modern geometries,\nanalytic projective geometry, and di\ufb00erential geometry. She taught in an NSF summer in-\nstitute in 1959 and in an academic year institute in 1965\u201366. She gave a number of talks,\nmainly in geometry; two were to the Veterans Math Club at the Fort Trumbull Division\nof the University of Connecticut in 1949 and 1950. From 1958 to 1970, as a member of\nthe MAA Speaker\u2019s Bureau, she spoke in high schools in the New York metropolitan area.\nShe was active in the Metropolitan New York Section of the History of Science Society,\nfor which she was chairman of the hospitality committee in the mid-1950s and was trea-\nsurer from 1959 for about a decade. She also was a member of the New York Academy\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nTULLER - 2\n\nof Sciences. Tuller did several pre-publication reviews for publishers, reviewed a number\nof books for Scripta Mathematica, worked for Collier\u2019s Encyclopedia on a revision of a\nbibliography in mathematics, and, most notably, wrote a widely used and admired text,\nA Modern Introduction to Geometries, which appeared in 1967.\n\nWhen her children were in elementary school, Tuller was active in the PTA. Later she\ndid community work as a member of the Briarwood Community Association and volunteer\nwork recording mathematics texts for the blind. She was a member of UNA-USA (United\nNations Association of the United States of America), the US Committee for UNICEF,\nCommon Cause, AARP, and was a registered Democrat.\n\nAnnita Tuller moved to a residence for senior citizens in Cupertino, California, after\nsu\ufb00ering a serious heart attack in early 1993.

June 4, 1912\u2013November 16, 1983.\nSaint Xavier College for Women (BS 1934), University of Chicago (MS 1936,\nPhD 1938).\n\nMary Barbara Haberzetle was born in Chicago, Illinois, the \ufb01rst of two daughters of\nHelen (Martin) (1886\u20131978) and William Thomas Haberzetle (1881\u20131955), both born in\nChicago. Her parents married in 1911. Her mother, orphaned at an early age, worked to\nsupport herself when young and determined that her children would receive an excellent\neducation. Her father was a saloon keeper in business with his brother. The younger\ndaughter, Florence, was born in 1914 and received her bachelor\u2019s degree from DePaul\nUniversity in 1936 and a master\u2019s degree from Chicago Teachers College in 1941. She\nworked as a secretary for a few years and then taught in the Chicago public schools for\ntwenty-six years.\n\nMary Haberzetle received her primary and secondary education in parochial schools in\nChicago run by the School Sisters of Notre Dame; she attended St. Anthony Grammar\nSchool and Academy of our Lady (also called Longwood Academy), where she was the\ntop scholar in her graduating class of 1930.\n\nHaberzetle entered Saint Xavier College for Women (now Saint Xavier University) in\nChicago, where she held a four-year scholarship, majored in mathematics, and graduated\nwith honors in 1934. During her studies at Saint Xavier, she was especially encouraged\nto do graduate work and urged to apply for a fellowship at the University of Chicago by\nEmily Pixley, a mathematics professor at Saint Xavier and a 1933 Chicago PhD.\n\nAfter graduating from Saint Xavier, Haberzetle worked as a social worker for the Cook\nCounty Welfare Department 1934\u201335 before beginning her graduate work at the University\nof Chicago in the autumn quarter of 1935. After receiving her master\u2019s degree in 1936, she\nwas a fellow her last two years of graduate study and received her doctorate in 1938.\n\nHaberzetle taught at Mount Holyoke College in the \ufb01rst semester of 1938, replacing\nFrances Baker who was on leave, and at Queens College in New York City 1939\u20131941.\nBetween 1937 and 1941 she published four papers. Her 1941 paper was mentioned that\nyear by Hans Rademacher in an AMS invited address, \u201cTrends in research: The analytic\nnumber theory,\u201d that appeared in the Bulletin of the AMS in 1942. Generalizations by\nothers of the results in 1941 appeared over the next twenty years. Although 1941 was\nsubmitted for publication after her marriage, it appeared under the name Mary Haberzetle.\nOn January 27, 1940, Mary Haberzetle married M. Jonathan Turner (1915\u20131995), who\nhad received a master\u2019s degree in mathematics from the University of Chicago in 1937.\nHe was a mathematics instructor 1937\u201340 and received an MS in aeronautical engineering\nfrom New York University in 1941. He worked as an engineer in structural technology\nfor the United Aircraft Corporation in Stratford, Connecticut, from 1941 until 1949 when\nthey moved to Seattle where he spent the rest of his career at the Boeing Company.\n\nThree children were born while they were in Connecticut: William Charles in 1942,\nRichard James in 1944, and Katherine Marie in 1947. All received PhD\u2019s from the Yale\ngraduate school in the 1970s: William and Richard in physics in 1973 and 1972, respec-\ntively, and Katherine in physical chemistry in 1976. Richard also received an MD from\nthe University of Miami in 1974.\n\nIn 1960, when the children were in their teens and approaching college age, Mary Turner\nresumed her teaching by taking a position at Seattle University as an assistant professor;\nshe was promoted to associate professor in 1963 and became a full professor in spring 1971\nshortly before the onset of illness hastened her retirement in June that year. Her sister,\nFlorence H. Baker, of Florida, has written that, \u201cshe had talent as an artist and enjoyed\nall the arts \u2013 painting, music, and weaving. She also enjoyed outdoor activities, hiking,\nmountain climbing, and snow-shoeing which she enjoyed during her retirement years.\u201d\nMary Haberzetle Turner died in Seattle, Washington, in 1983 at age seventy-one.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nTURNER, M.

      "text": "BROWN, Eleanor (Pairman). June 8, 1896\u2013September 14, 1973.\nUniversity of Edinburgh (MA 1917), Radcliffe College (PhD 1922).\n\nEleanor Pairman was born in Broomieknowe, Lasswade, in the parish of Cockpen,\nMidlothian, Scotland, the youngest of four daughters of Helen (Dunlop) (b. ca.\n1858) and John Pairman (b. ca. 1854), solicitor, Supreme Courts of Scotland. Her\nparents married in Edinburgh on July 1, 1886. Her father died when she was quite\nyoung, apparently before 1901, leaving her mother with few resources to raise her\nfamily. Eleanor\u2019s sisters were Maxwell (Maxie) (b. ca. 1888), Margaret (Madge)\n(b. ca. 1890), and Adeline (Aline) (b. ca. 1891); they did not marry. According to\ninformation supplied by John Pairman Brown, Eleanor\u2019s eldest son, Maxie taught\nat a boarding school in England; Madge was proprietor of a tea shop, \u201cThe Ancient\nGrudge,\u201d northeast of Edinburgh; and Aline did some baby minding and kept the\nPairman family home in Broomieknowe. Eleanor was known as Nora by her family.\nNora Pairman attended Lasswade Higher Grade School 1903\u201308 and George\nWatson\u2019s Ladies\u2019 College 1908\u201314 before enrolling in the University of Edinburgh.\nThree years later, in 1917, she received her MA with \ufb01rst class honours in math-\nematics and natural philosophy. At that time the master\u2019s degree was the \ufb01rst\ndegree given in universities in Scotland. The year she received her master\u2019s degree,\nshe was awarded the Vans Dunlop scholarship in mathematics, a three-year schol-\narship, awarded by competitive examination, which could be used for study at any\nuniversity. It was awarded for \u201c \u2018distinguished pro\ufb01ciency\u2019 in the various subjects\nof competition as determined by the Examiners and the Senatus Academicus\u201d (Ed-\ninburgh University Calendar 1917\u20131918, 269). Pairman continued her studies as a\ngraduate student in mathematics at the University of Edinburgh 1917\u201318.\n\nEleanor Pairman read two papers at meetings of the Edinburgh Mathematical\nSociety early in 1918. On February 4, 1918, Cargill G. Knott, then president of\nthe society and one of Pairman\u2019s instructors at Edinburgh, wrote a letter of rec-\nommendation to the dean of Radcli\ufb00e College in Massachusetts. He indicated that\nPairman intended to continue her studies at Radcli\ufb00e. He wrote:\n\nThroughout her career as an undergraduate Miss Pairman\u2019s ex-\nceptional mathematical abilities were in strong evidence. Although\nher natural inclinations were towards Pure Mathematics, she easily\nmastered the Principles and Methods of Applied Mathematics, and\ngained the Medal in both my Honours Classes in Dynamics and Hy-\ndrodynamics, and this among a group of students of marked ability.\nMiss Pairman also attended a short course I give on Hamiltonian\nQuaternions with Physical Applications, and there I was impressed\nwith her capacity for appreciating the theoretical foundations of\nthe calculus.\n\nVery rarely indeed have we had the good fortune of teaching\na student with such a strong predilection for mathematical study\nas Miss Pairman undoubtedly possesses. With \ufb01tting opportunity\nshe has every promise of a distinguished and useful career. (Letter\nprovided to author by John Pairman Brown)\n\nDuring 1918\u201319 Pairman was a graduate student in applied statistics at the Uni-\nversity of London and joined the sta\ufb00 of Karl Pearson\u2019s laboratory in the Depart-\nment of Applied Statistics at University College London. In 1919 they published an\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBROWN - 2\n\narticle in Biometrika, a journal that Pearson edited. In the same issue in which their\narticle appeared, Pearson published an editorial, \u201cPeccavimus! [We have sinned!],\u201d\nin which he corrected a previous article and noted, \u201cAs the problem is an exceed-\ningly important one the writer asked Miss Eleanor Pairman to revise his work. . . .\nThis she has done with certain additions and expansions\u201d (12:267). Also in 1919,\nPairman produced the \ufb01rst volume of tables in the Tracts for Computers series\nedited by Pearson.\n\nAt about the same time, Karl Pearson wrote to the United States consul in Lon-\ndon indicating that Pairman had been granted a scholarship at Radcli\ufb00e College,\nnoting that he had done what he could to obtain a passport for her, and requesting\nthat she be admitted to the United States. Eleanor Pairman arrived in New York\nfrom London on October 12, 1919, to begin her studies at Radcli\ufb00e College. She\n\ufb01nished her dissertation in analysis under the direction of G. D. Birkho\ufb00 in the\nfall of 1921 and received her doctorate from Radcli\ufb00e College in 1922. She was the\nthird of nine women to receive a doctorate in mathematics from Radcli\ufb00e before\n1940.\n\nOn August 10, 1922, Eleanor Pairman and Bancroft Huntington Brown, a fellow\ngraduate student, were married at Roselea, the Pairman home in Broomieknowe,\nScotland. B. H. Brown was born on November 11, 1894, in Hyde Park, Mas-\nsachusetts, and received a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1916 and a master\u2019s degree in 1917\nfrom Brown University. B. H. Brown served in the US Army 1917\u201319; an article\nby Fenster, Kent, and Archibald notes that he was discharged in order to teach at\nHarvard University, where mathematics instructors were urgently needed. He served\nas instructor 1919\u201321 and continued his graduate work in mathematics there. He\nreceived his doctorate in June 1922, the same time as Eleanor Pairman.\n\nAfter receiving their doctorates, Bancroft and Nora Brown moved to Hanover,\nNew Hampshire, where B. H. Brown joined the faculty of Dartmouth College, then\na men\u2019s school with an all-male faculty that had occasionally admitted women as\ngraduate students. He remained at Dartmouth his entire career; he was an instructor\n1922\u201324, assistant professor 1924\u201331, professor 1931\u201346, and B. P. Cheney professor\nuntil his retirement in 1962. He was director of the Navy V-12 mathematics training\nprogram at Dartmouth 1943\u201345.\n\nThe Browns had four children: John Pairman (1923\u20132010), Barbara (1925\u20131979),\nJoanna (1935\u20131935), and Margaret Wylde (b. 1937). Soon after her \ufb01rst two chil-\ndren were born, Eleanor P. Brown published a paper with Rudolph E. Langer that\nhad originated in Brown\u2019s dissertation. Langer was another 1922 Birkho\ufb00 student\nwho had also come to Dartmouth in 1922, and who remained on the faculty there\nuntil 1925.\n\nJohn Pairman Brown, the eldest child, majored in mathematics and classics at\nDartmouth, was in the US Army Air Corps, was a junior fellow at Harvard, and\nlater earned a doctorate from Union Theological Seminary. His positions included\nones at American University of Beirut, the Ecumenical Peace Institute in San Fran-\ncisco, the Northern California Ecumenical Council, and the Graduate Theological\nUnion, among others. He served as a representative to peace events at various places\nthroughout the world and published extensively, mainly in classics and on New and\nOld Testament themes. Barbara Brown graduated from Vassar in three years after\nmajoring in English and classics. She earned both a master\u2019s degree and a PhD in\nlanguage and literature from Rutgers University and was a lecturer in English at\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBROWN - 3\n\nthe Rutgers Newark campus for several years before her death at \ufb01fty-four. Mar-\ngaret Brown studied at Brown University and became a medical editor and medical\ntranscriptionist. All of the children married and had families.\n\nMost summers the Brown family went to Martha\u2019s Vineyard, where B. H. Brown\u2019s\nparents had a small cottage. His parents also spent about four months a year with\nthe Browns in Hanover. Otherwise, there was little traveling; neither Nora nor B.\nH. Brown drove an automobile or traveled by air. However, Nora Brown did take\nJohn and Barbara, the two older children, to Scotland for visits twice when they\nwere young, once in summer 1929 and again in summer 1934; and in March of 1936,\nshe and Barbara made a trip to Bermuda. Also, often in the spring she took a train\nto Boston to see the \ufb02ower show and stayed overnight.\n\nIt appears that Nora Brown began to learn Braille in about the late 1940s or\nearly 1950s. Her daughter Margaret recalled that after learning regular Braille, she\nthen learned the Nemeth Code for mathematical notation. In a letter to one of the\nauthors, Margaret wrote, \u201cGeometry was a particular problem, because you really\nneed diagrams. Braille is done on paper like thin cardstock. So she rounded up\nall kinds of household implements like pinking shears and pastry wheels and such\nand created diagrams that could be felt with the \ufb01ngers, like the Braille symbols.\nApparently nobody had ever done this before.\u201d Nora Brown\u2019s son-in-law Thomas\nStreeter recalled a visit to Hanover in which he was shown some of her work. \u201cA\ngraduate student at Harvard was blind and needed a particular book put into\nBraille, and it was full of mathematical symbols. What to do? The sewing machine,\nof course. She had written down the math and had it beside the machine. She put\na piece of Braille paper under the foot and proceeded to reproduce the symbols\nby guiding the paper under the needle. It had to be the mirror image of what\nshe had written.\u201d An article in the Hanover Gazette, probably published in 1959,\nindicated that she had just returned from attending the Third Annual Conference\nof the National Braille Club in New York, where mathematical workshops were\ndirected by Abraham Nemeth. The article indicated that she was transcribing two\nmathematical texts, one for a freshman at Boston College and one a reference book\non group theory for a post-graduate course at Columbia University. The article also\nnoted that in addition to her work with Braille, she was holding conferences with\nDartmouth freshmen three hours a week, and that she had taken over a course at\nthe end of spring term.\n\nHer daughter Margaret also wrote: \u201cFor all the satisfaction that she got from\nthese [Braille] projects, the only time I saw her truly happy was when she was\nteaching. And she had precious little opportunity to do that, being obviously ahead\nof her time and also stuck in a males-only college community and in a world where\nit was well-nigh impossible for married ladies to function professionally.\u201d Eleanor\nP. Brown was, however, a part-time instructor of mathematics at Dartmouth from\nSeptember 1955 until June 1959.\n\nAfter a lengthy illness, Eleanor P. Brown developed metastatic breast cancer\nand was in a nursing home in nearby White River Junction, Vermont, until her\ndeath there at age seventy-seven in 1973. She was survived by her husband, two\nsisters, three children, seven grandchildren, and one great-granddaughter. Bancroft\nH. Brown died on May 7 the following year.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBROWN - 4\n\nTheses and dissertation:\n1920 [Pairman, E.] Singular points of algebraic space curves.

October 4, 1876\u2013December 31, 1960.\nUniversity of Wisconsin (BL 1900, ML 1901, PhD 1907).\n\nFlorence Eliza Allen was born in Horicon, Wisconsin, the second child and only\ndaughter of Eliza (North) (b. 1848), of Wisconsin, and Charles Allen (b. ca. 1836),\na native of New York. Her parents married in 1866. Her father was a lawyer, who,\nit appears, died in 1890. In 1900, she, her mother, and her brother, Charles Elmer\nAllen (1872\u20131954), were living in Madison, Wisconsin.\n\nFlorence Allen was a mathematics major as an undergraduate in the College\nof Letters and Science at the University of Wisconsin. She was active in Castalia,\na literary society for women promoting interest in the \ufb01ne arts, and served as\nsecretary and president. She was on the executive board of the self government\nassociation, was on the yearbook board, and was a member of Delta Delta Delta\nsocial sorority. Florence Allen received her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1900, a year after\nher older brother, who had taught and worked as a court reporter before studying\nat Wisconsin. They shared the same address, presumably with their mother, from\nthe fall of 1896 until 1902. Charles E. Allen received his PhD in botany in 1904\nfrom the University of Wisconsin and was on the faculty there from 1901 to 1943,\nwhen he retired as professor emeritus. He had attained the rank of professor in\n1909. During his distinguished career he published extensively, was editor-in-chief\nof The American Journal of Botany, was president of his professional associations,\nreceived an honorary doctorate from the University of Chicago, and was elected to\nthe National Academy of Sciences.\n\nFlorence Allen stayed at Wisconsin as a resident graduate in mathematics and\nphilosophy 1900\u201301 and received her master\u2019s degree in mathematics in 1901. She\nwas an assistant in mathematics at Wisconsin in 1901\u201302 and then became an\ninstructor of mathematics. She remained at that rank for forty-three years, even\nthough she had obtained her doctorate with a dissertation in geometry in 1907\nand published her dissertation in 1914 and two additional research articles in 1915\nand 1927. She became an assistant professor in the fall of 1945, shortly before\nher sixty-ninth birthday. Her promotion came two years before she retired at the\nrank of assistant professor emeritus. During her years at Wisconsin, in addition to\nher regular teaching and committee responsibilities, she sometimes taught summer\ncourses, and she was active in planning and reporting on reunions for her class of\n1900 in the Wisconsin alumni magazine.\n\nAs part of her entry in the 1914 Woman\u2019s Who\u2019s Who of America, Allen indi-\ncated that she favored women\u2019s su\ufb00rage. In response to an inquiry by Helen Owens\nconcerning the outlook for women doctorates in mathematics, Allen wrote on June\n8, 1940:\n\nOf course there will always be some women who should go in for a\nPh.D. \u2013 some because it will be an actual necessity to qualify them\nfor one of the occasional \u2013 very occasional \u2013 openings in college and\nuniversity positions, some because of the leisure they may have to\nfollow a congenial pursuit. But on the whole I see no great encour-\nagement to be had from past experiences and observation. I do not\nbelieve that there is or will be a great future for any but a few in\nthis \ufb01eld. At present, it seems to me, as I look about this campus,\nthat in all strictly academic \ufb01elds (not those special to women) that\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nALLEN, F.

Allen was a member of the Wisconsin Academy of Sciences, Arts\nand Letters and of the Congregational Church. She had lived at the same house on\nLathrop Street in Madison for more than \ufb01fty years before her death at eighty-four\nin a Madison, Wisconsin, hospital in 1960.

      "text": "OWENS, Helen (Brewster). April 2, 1881\u2013June 6, 1968.\nUniversity of Kansas (BA 1900, MA 1901), Cornell University (PhD 1910).\n\nHelen Barten Brewster was born in Pleasanton, Linn County, Kansas, the only\nchild of Clara (Linton) (1850\u20131933), originally of Ohio, and Robert Edward Brew-\nster (b. ca. 1840), a native of New York. In 1880 her parents were living in Linn\nCounty, where her father, a Civil War veteran, was a farmer. Her parents had\nmarried in about 1880, and it appears her father died in 1892.\n\nHelen Brewster did her college preparation in three years at the Pleasanton High\nSchool and entered the University of Kansas in Lawrence in September 1897, when\nshe was sixteen. In the 1900 census she was enumerated with her widowed mother,\na school teacher, and with her maternal grandmother in Pleasanton. She and her\nmother were enumerated a second time in 1900 as boarders in Lawrence, where she\nwas a student.\n\nHelen B. Brewster earned her bachelor\u2019s degree from Kansas in 1900 and her\nmaster\u2019s degree in 1901. The following year she was a teaching fellow at Kansas\nand published an article, possibly her master\u2019s thesis, in which she expressed her\ngratitude to Henry B. Newson, the husband of Mary Winston Newson. In a letter\nof January 31, 1936, she wrote to \u201cMrs. Newson\u201d that \u201cthrough all these years you\nand your husband have been vital in\ufb02uences in our lives\u201d (transcription in authors\u2019\npossession). Brewster continued her graduate studies at the University of Kansas\nuntil June 1903 and taught high school in Lawrence from 1902 until 1904.\n\nOn June 22, 1904, in Pleasanton, Kansas, Helen Brewster married Frederick\nWilliam Owens, who had also studied mathematics with H. B. Newson at the Uni-\nversity of Kansas. F. W. Owens was born in Rockwell City, Iowa, on November\n18, 1880. He received a bachelor\u2019s degree and a master\u2019s degree from Kansas in\n1902 and remained as a teaching fellow 1902\u201303. During 1903\u201305 he was a resi-\ndent graduate student in mathematics and astronomy at the University of Chicago.\nHelen B. Owens studied at the University of Chicago in the summer and autumn\nquarters of 1904. Their \ufb01rst daughter, Helen Brewster, was born in May 1905 in Illi-\nnois. F. W. Owens taught at the academy of Northwestern University in Evanston,\nIllinois, 1905\u201307, and Helen Owens returned to high school teaching in 1906 and\ntaught through 1907 in Evanston. In 1907 F. W. Owens received his PhD from the\nUniversity of Chicago and took a position as instructor of mathematics at Cor-\nnell University in Ithaca, New York. Their second daughter, Clara Brewster, was\nborn in February 1908. Helen Owens enrolled as a graduate student at Cornell the\nfollowing academic year and received her PhD in 1910 with a dissertation written\nunder the direction of Virgil Snyder. She presented minors in physics with Ernest\nMerritt and mathematical physics with James McMahon.\n\nHelen Owens worked as a private teacher of mathematics in Ithaca for several\nyears starting in 1908 and taught at Wells College, a women\u2019s college in Aurora,\nabout thirty miles from Ithaca, on two occasions. She was an instructor at Wells\nsecond semester 1914\u201315 and an acting assistant professor second semester 1916\u201317.\nIn the \ufb01rst term of 1916\u201317 she successfully completed a Cornell graduate course,\nClothing 16, a sewing course that would have been o\ufb00ered by the home economics\ndepartment of the Cornell College of Agriculture.\n\nFrom 1911 to 1917 Owens also campaigned for women\u2019s su\ufb00rage in Kansas and\nin New York State. Owens was a state organizer for the Kansas Equal Su\ufb00rage\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nOWENS - 2\n\nAssociation during the successful campaign of 1911\u201312. A newspaper article based\non an interview with Owens in 1960 reported that \u201cher \ufb01rst interest in women\u2019s\nsu\ufb00rage started, when, as a small child, she accompanied her mother, [who was]\npresident of the Linn County Women\u2019s Su\ufb00rage Assn. in Kansas, to the County\nFair\u201d (\u201cWomen Voters to Mark 40th\u201d). She also said that at the fair she helped\ndistribute copies of a photograph of the temperance leader, Frances Willard, that\nhad been taken with \u201cher \u2018political peers,\u2019 the disenfranchised men, including ma-\nniacs, condemned criminals, idiots and such.\u201d In 1911 her mother was invited to\nKansas to lecture on women\u2019s su\ufb00rage; Helen Owens went instead. In a 1943 article\non the Kansas su\ufb00rage campaign, it was reported that \u201cDr. Helen Brewster Owens,\na Kansas girl living in New York, o\ufb00ered to pay her way to Kansas and give eight\nweeks of her time to the work, providing her expenses in the state were paid. She\ncame in November and proved a most e\ufb03cient organizer. The next year she re-\nturned and was paid by the national association\u201d (\u201cThe woman su\ufb00rage campaign\nof 1912,\u201d 304). The article credits the help of out-of-state workers for the successful\ncampaign. In particular, Owens \u201cremained as a \ufb01eld organizer until the last of July\n[1912] when overcome by heat, she went home for a month\u2019s rest. Returning the\nfollowing September, she worked unceasingly until the election\u201d (p. 312). After her\nexperience in Kansas, Owens continued her work for women\u2019s su\ufb00rage in New York\nState as a district chairman of the Empire State Campaign Committee 1913\u201315\nwhile Carrie Chapman Catt was president of the state organization. Although the\n1915 referendum was unsuccessful, Owens remained active in the state campaign\nuntil women in New York won the right to vote in 1917.\n\nShe wrote for her entry in J. W. Leonard\u2019s 1914 Woman\u2019s Who\u2019s Who of America\nthat she was \u201cinterested in various organizations for civic improvement and high\nideals\u201d (p. 615). She included her presidencies of the Political Study Club of Ithaca\nand the Tompkins County Equal Su\ufb00rage Association, as well as memberships in\nthe Woman\u2019s Christian Temperance Union, the Civic Improvement League, and the\nCornell Consumers\u2019 League.\n\nHelen Owens was an instructor at Cornell University 1917\u20131922, where she\ntaught such courses as advanced algebra, advanced analytic geometry, calculus, dif-\nferential equations, and projective geometry. Owens also sometimes served as the\nfaculty advisor to the Cornell mathematics club that was organized in November\n1919. During the years 1908 to 1926 she was intermittently employed as a secondary\nschool teacher and as a private tutor, and in 1922 she was the \ufb01rst national treasurer\nof Sigma Delta Epsilon (now Sigma Delta Epsilon-Graduate Women in Science), a\nfraternal order for graduate women in science founded at Cornell in 1921.\n\nIn 1926 F. W. Owens assumed the headship of the mathematics department\nat Pennsylvania State College (now Pennsylvania State University) in State Col-\nlege. After their move to Pennsylvania, Helen Owens returned to Ithaca for private\ntutoring for three months each academic year until 1928.\n\nIn the letter of January 31, 1936, to Mary Winston Newson, Helen Owens re-\ncounts a number of events in her life and describes some aspects of her current\nsituation. She noted that both of her daughters graduated from Cornell, but then\nrecounted \u201ccrushing blows.\u201d First, her elder daughter, Helen, had died in 1928. \u201cI\nstill \ufb01nd myself unreconciled and incapable of talking about it.\u201d Newspaper ac-\ncounts at the time indicate that, according to friends, Helen, a medical student\nat the University of Chicago, drank poison, partly out of despair over her desire\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nOWENS - 3\n\nto marry, which was in con\ufb02ict with her parents\u2019 wishes that she wait until she\n\ufb01nished medical school, and partly because of her lack of success in some of her\ncourses. The younger daughter, Clara, married a medical school classmate in June\n1930, and both received their MD degrees from Cornell University Medical College\nand became parents of a son in June 1931. Owens continued her description of\nthe \u201ccrushing blows\u201d to include the December 1931 death of Clara\u2019s husband as\na result of a staphylococci infection caused when he \u201cnipped a tiny pimple on his\nupper lip in shaving.\u201d Clara began her residency in New York the following month\nwhile Helen and Frederick Owens cared for her son. After beginning her practice in\nState College in October 1933, Clara and her young son, continued to live in the\nOwens household until at least sometime in 1936. Helen Owens also related that\nher mother, who had lived with them for twenty-six years, had died in the spring\nof 1933.\n\nHelen Owens then moved on to happier topics in her letter and described her\nteaching and tutoring before her eldest daughter\u2019s death. She also noted in the\nmargin, \u201cI see I did not explain \u2013 a state ruling makes it impossible for two members\nof same family to teach at same school.\u201d She wrote that she would regularly get\ntogether with the women in the Penn State mathematics department, Teresa Cohen,\nBeatrice Hagen, and Aline Huke Frink, and read mathematical textbooks; they had\nread Sierpinski\u2019s Introduction to General Topology and were then reading Harold\nHilton\u2019s Plane Algebraic Curves.\n\nIn 1934 Helen B. and F. W. Owens took a trip that included visits to all forty-\neight states as well as Mexico and Canada. In March they stopped in Topeka,\nKansas, to attend a meeting of the Kansas Section of the MAA. The report of\nthe meeting noted that they \u201cwere passing through Kansas on their way to a six\nmonths\u2019 rest in California\u201d (Amer. Math. Monthly 41:405). Other mathematics\nmeetings they attended that year were an AMS meeting in June in Berkeley, Cali-\nfornia, the AMS and MAA summer meetings in Williamstown, Massachusetts, an\nAMS meeting in October in New York City, and the annual December AMS and\nMAA meetings in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania. They had been attending the summer\nmeetings every year since 1929, and from 1934 until the United States entered World\nWar II in December 1941 they attended an average of two other AMS meetings a\nyear.\n\nFrom 1935 to 1938 Helen Owens was an associate editor of the American Math-\nematical Monthly and edited the Mathematical Clubs section with her husband.\nDuring the late 1930s she formed a committee for the study of women\u2019s work in\nmathematics; she corresponded with various institutions and organizations and sent\nquestionnaires to those North American women she was able to identify as holding\nPhD\u2019s in mathematics. At the summer mathematics meetings of 1937 in State Col-\nlege, she organized a luncheon honoring women pioneers in mathematical research\nin America. R. G. D. Richardson, then secretary of the AMS, suggested that she\nprepare a talk on her \ufb01ndings to be given to the MAA and a paper for inclusion\nin the Monthly. Although that presentation was never made, she did circulate a\nsecond round of questionnaires in 1940 and, at about that time, gave a speech,\nmost likely at a meeting of Sigma Delta Epsilon, \u201cEarly Scienti\ufb01c Work of Women\nand Women in Mathematics.\u201d Correspondence, completed questionnaires, a copy of\nthe talk, and other materials related to her study of women\u2019s work in mathematics\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nOWENS - 4\n\nare in her papers at the Schlesinger Library. Notes for, and a draft of, a book on\nwomen in mathematics and science are also listed as being in these papers.\n\nSeveral of the letters in Owens\u2019 papers at the Schlesinger Library indicate that\nshe was much appreciated by other women mathematicians. For example, on Feb-\nruary 4, 1937, Sister Mary Felice Vaudreuil wrote about the 1936 summer meetings:\n\u201cWe Sisters appreciated very much your kind friendliness toward us at the Boston\nmeeting. I can well understand that most people do not know what to make of us so\nwe appreciate the more the friendliness of those who are kind to us. Such meetings\nare a very great inspiration and I like to attend them in spite of the fact that my\ndress seems out of place.\u201d Later, on May 22, 1940, Ruth Mason Ballard wrote to\nOwens that \u201cyou were so kind to me . . . when I was homeless and jobless, that you\nhave a very special place in my regard.\u201d\n\nIn 1940 Helen Owens was hired as an instructor by Pennsylvania State College\nand was promoted to assistant professor in 1945. Both she and her husband retired\nin 1949, she as assistant professor emeritus and he as professor emeritus. They were\nliving in State College at the time of the death of F. W. Owens on June 23, 1961.\nShe lived the last three years of her life at the home of her surviving daughter, a\nphysician at the Newton D. Baker Veterans Hospital in Martinsburg, West Virginia.\nHelen B. Owens died in Martinsburg in 1968 at age eighty-seven. In her 1936 letter\nto Mary Newson she had expressed her preference for cremation.

      "text": "HUMPHREYS, M. Gweneth. October 22, 1911\u2013October 6, 2006.\nUniversity of British Columbia (BA 1932), Smith College (MA 1933), Univer-\nsity of Chicago (PhD 1935).\n\nMabel Gweneth Humphreys was born in South Vancouver, British Columbia, the\nonly child of Mabel Jane (Thomas) (1885\u20131963) and Richard Humphreys (1880\u2013\n1969). Her mother was born in London, England, and was a dressmaker, \ufb02orist, and\nhousewife. Her father was born in Pwllheli in Northwest Wales and was a machin-\nist. They were married in 1910. Her secondary education was in North Vancouver,\nBritish Columbia. She attended North Vancouver High School 1925\u201328, the Uni-\nversity of British Columbia 1928\u201332, Smith College 1932\u201333, and the University of\nChicago 1933\u201335.\n\nHumphreys held scholarships all four years she was an undergraduate at the\nUniversity of British Columbia before graduating with honors in mathematics and\nearning the Governor General\u2019s Gold Medal in 1932. In 1981 she described how\nshe came to study and live in the United States. \u201cWhen I graduated in \u201932 the\nappropriation for the university had been cut so much that they stopped giving\ngraduate work in mathematics that year. I was supposed to have an assistantship\nbut it \u2018melted away.\u2019 So, [Professor F. S. Nolan] helped me apply for scholarships,\nfellowships in the United States and in Canada. And I received one at Smith College,\na fellowship, and went there for my master\u2019s degree\u201d (Smithsonian meeting tapes).\nAt Smith she studied with Professors Neal McCoy, Susan Rambo, and Ruth G.\nWood before receiving her master\u2019s degree in 1933. She also reported that Nolan and\nanother of the mathematics professors at the University of British Columbia had\ngotten their doctorates at the University of Chicago. Therefore, after receiving her\nmaster\u2019s degree, Humphreys applied to Chicago where she was awarded a fellowship\nthat she held for the next two years. She earned her PhD in 1935, having written\nher dissertation in number theory as a student of L. E. Dickson. Each year that she\nwas at Chicago, she gave a talk at the department\u2019s Junior Mathematics Club.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD, Humphreys remained in the United States and became\na naturalized citizen in 1941. In 1981 she recalled her \ufb01rst attempts to \ufb01nd a job.\n\nI had hoped that the University of Chicago would hear about a job\nfor me, but only one came through, and the male candidate who\ngot his thesis at the same time got that job. In the meantime, I had\nregistered at a teacher\u2019s agency in downtown Chicago, and many\ncards came in for the sum of something like $900, and you taught all\nthe mathematics in the four years, and you were dean of women, or\nall of mathematics and coach some sport. I said to myself I wasn\u2019t\ngoing to do this; I was going to stick around in Chicago and wait\ntables somewhere and study more mathematics. After awhile a card\ncame through from Kansas, a woman\u2019s college, and they needed a\nwoman with a PhD in either mathematics or physics to teach both.\nThis was a substitute position, which was vacant because Sr. Helen\nSullivan . . . was ill. I took that and taught there for that one year.\nI was very busy I must say, but it was a great apprenticeship. I\nenjoyed it very much. (Smithsonian meeting tapes)\n\nThus, her \ufb01rst position was instructor of mathematics and physics, 1935\u201336, at\nMt. St. Scholastica College in Atchison, Kansas. Emma Olson was acting head of\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHUMPHREYS - 2\n\nthe department the previous year and Sister M. Helen Sullivan became head in\n1935. In 1936 Humphreys became an instructor at H. Sophie Newcomb Memorial\nCollege in New Orleans, Louisiana, where Nola Anderson (Haynes) was department\nchairman. In 1941, with Marie Weiss as chairman, Humphreys was promoted to\nassistant professor. In the summers of 1944 and 1946, she was assistant professor\nat Barnard College and Tulane University, respectively.\n\nIn 1949 Humphreys left Newcomb to become associate professor at Randolph-\nMacon Woman\u2019s College (now Randolph College) in Lynchburg, Virginia, where\nshe was to remain for the rest of her career. That same year Gillie Larew, who had\nbeen chairman since 1936, became dean of the college. At the end of Humphreys\u2019\n\ufb01rst year at Randolph-Macon she was named Larew Professor and head of the\ndepartment. She remained as head until 1979. In 1973 she was also named Dana\nProfessor; she retired in 1980 as the Gillie A. Larew and Charles A. Dana Professor\nEmeritus. During her tenure at Randolph-Macon, she was on sabbatical leave and\nholder of a faculty fellowship from the Fund for the Advancement of Education in\nthe academic year 1955\u201356, during which she studied at the University of British\nColumbia and examined undergraduate programs at several colleges and universities\nduring short visits. She was a National Science Foundation faculty fellow 1962\u201363\nwhile on sabbatical as a visiting professor at the University of British Columbia.\n\nFor most summers from 1959 to 1970 Humphreys taught in NSF summer in-\nstitutes for high school teachers held at Randolph-Macon. From 1965 to 1969 she\nworked for the Educational Testing Service; she was on a committee to construct\na new institutional mathematics test 1965\u201367 and served as a consultant for the\nmathematics undergraduate record examination 1967\u201369. In 1975 she was a con-\nsultant for the American Council on Education on credit for mathematics courses\ngiven by nonacademic organizations.\n\nHumphreys was active in the MAA at both the sectional and national levels.\nShe was vice-chairman of the Maryland-District of Columbia-Virginia Section of\nthe MAA 1952\u201353 and 1957\u201358. At the national level, she served on the Commit-\ntee on Mathematical Personnel and Education in the mid-1950s, on the Board of\nGovernors 1962\u201365 as Governor of her section, and on the Committee on the Un-\ndergraduate Program in Mathematics (CUPM) 1965\u201367. She was on the CUPM ad\nhoc committee to prepare a report identifying quali\ufb01cations for a college teacher\nof mathematics; the committee prepared a report published by CUPM in 1967.\nHumphreys was also on the CUPM Panel on Mathematics in Two-Year Colleges\n1966\u201367 and on the Joint Interim Central Coordinating Committee on Films and\nTelevision in the early 1960s. She was an MAA consultant and visiting lecturer\n1973\u201375.\n\nFrom the 1950s through the 1970s Humphreys gave many presentations across\nVirginia and the rest of the country. In the 1960s she often spoke at conferences\nabout the CUPM recommendations for the mathematics curriculum, while in the\n1970s she spoke at schools about mathematics in music and art. She produced two\nsets of lecture notes. One, \u201cLinear algebra and analysis,\u201d was joint with H. F. Davis\nand comprised notes for a course given at the University of British Columbia in\n1956\u201357; another, \u201cLinear algebra and geometry,\u201d appeared in many versions, the\nlatest in 1974.\n\nHumphreys served as vice president of the local chapter of AAUP 1959 and 1974\u2013\n75 and as president 1959\u201360 and 1973\u201374. She was treasurer of the local chapter\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHUMPHREYS - 3\n\nof Sigma Xi 1960\u201361 and 1966\u201368, secretary 1968\u201370, vice president 1970\u201372, and\npresident 1972\u201374.\n\nIn 1981 Humphreys listed her hobbies as gardening and reading. She was active\nin the Natural Bridge Appalachian Trail Club and served as a member of the\ncouncil in 1954, 1955, 1970, and 1971. She continued to live in Lynchburg after\nher retirement in 1980 and died at home in 2006, shortly before her ninety-\ufb01fth\nbirthday. Her obituary indicates that she was \u201csurvived by her friends and other\nretirees from Randolph Macon Woman\u2019s College.\u201d Her estate included a bequest of\n$24,000 to the MAA.\n\nAt Humphreys\u2019 memorial service a tribute by her former student Carol Wood\nwas read. Wood noted that \u201cthe words \u2018supportive\u2019 and \u2018empowering\u2019 were not\ncurrent in the 60s but they apply to Gwen\u2019s demeanor towards her students, however\nundeserving and naive we were. Several of us have gone on to careers involving\nsubstantial mathematics, and owe a debt to her\u201d (Benkart 2010, 14). Wood, a former\npresident of the Association for Women in Mathematics, later proposed that AWM\nestablish a mentoring award in Humphrey\u2019s honor, and this was done in 2010. The\nM. Gweneth Humphreys Award was funded by former students and colleagues from\nRandolph-Macon to \u201crecognize an undergraduate mathematics teacher . . . who\nhas had a signi\ufb01cant impact on one or more female students through mentoring\u201d\n(Benkart 2010, 13).\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, SIAM, NCTM, Canadian Math.

The household also included six other family members and\nsix servants. This was the primary residence for Emily Coddington until her marriage.\n\nCoddington studied at private schools in the New York City area, beginning with\nMrs. Wallin\u2019s Kindergarten and including Miss Mason\u2019s School in Tarrytown and Miss\nPeebles\u2019 School and the Brearley School in New York City until 1892. In 1891, while at\nthe Brearley School, she was one of four women to earn a certi\ufb01cate for having passed\nsatisfactorily the examinations for women \u201cin accordance with the terms prescribed for\nadmission to the Freshman Class of Harvard College\u201d (Harvard University Catalogue 1891\u2013\n92, 399). This certi\ufb01cate entitled Coddington to admission to the \u201cHarvard Annex,\u201d a\nCambridge institution for women run by the Society for Collegiate Instruction of Women.\nThe \u201cHarvard Annex\u201d o\ufb00ered classes taught by Harvard faculty and was the precursor to\nRadcli\ufb00e College. While there is no indication that she attended the \u201cHarvard Annex,\u201d\nCoddington matriculated at the University of London in June 1894 and received her\nIntermediate Arts in 1895 and her BA in 1896. Also in 1896 she wrote what would be her\nmaster\u2019s thesis for a degree in mathematics, with minors in mechanics and Greek, that was\nawarded two years later by Columbia University. She wrote both this thesis and her PhD\ndissertation on historical topics. In her dissertation she referred to several papers by the\nSwedish geometer A. V. B\u00a8acklund. Some time before she received her doctorate in 1905 she\npublished an English translation of an 1883 paper of his. Although Coddington never took\nany paid positions in mathematics, she did maintain some contact with the mathematical\ncommunity. She kept her membership in the AMS until her death. She attended the\nInternational Congress of Mathematicians in Rome in 1908 and in Cambridge, England,\nin 1912, and she often attended meetings of the AMS in New York City until shortly\nbefore her marriage in 1917.\n\nIn 1903 Emily Coddington became a member of the Women\u2019s Advisory Committee of\nNew York University\u2019s Council of the University. She attended the Law School of NYU\nstarting in 1909 and was admitted to the New York Bar in January 1912 before receiving\nher law degree from New York University in 1913. In her 1911 application to the Committee\non Character of the Bar Association she indicated that she had neither been employed in,\nnor studied law in, a law o\ufb03ce, nor had she ever been engaged in any business or profession\nother than the law. A decade later she indicated that she had never practiced law. The\nNew York Times listed Coddington among the \u201cmany prominent New York women\u201d to be\nseated in boxes at an anti-su\ufb00rage meeting to be held at Carnegie Hall in 1915. She also\ncontinued her service on the NYU Women\u2019s Advisory Committee and served as treasurer\nat least during 1907\u201308 and as secretary at least during 1915\u201317.\n\nOn November 5, 1917, at the age of forty-four, Coddington married William Henry\nWilliams (1876\u20131943), an executive with an exporting business at the time of their mar-\nriage. William Henry Williams had been educated at Pratt Institute and Packard Business\nCollege and was chairman of the board of North Central Texas Oil Company at the time\nof his death. Both before and after her marriage Emily Coddington Williams lived in\nNew York City, although she and her husband also had a summer home, Villa Rosa, in\nNewport, Rhode Island. They had no children.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWILLIAMS, E. C. - 2\n\nEmily Coddington Williams had wide-ranging interests. They included gardening, ge-\nnealogy, and the writing of \ufb01ction among many others. In particular, she was an active\nmember of the Garden Club of America, was at one time on the board of directors of\nthe International Garden Club in Pelham Bay Park, and belonged to the Tuxedo, Piping\nRock, Colony, and Cosmopolitan clubs. In 1914 she secured a copyright for a typed one-act\nplay called \u201cThen.\u201d After her marriage she published another one-act play, two novels,\nand a sketch of William Coddington, a colonial governor of Rhode Island.\n\nDuring the course of her life Emily C. Williams made many trips to Europe, frequently\nwith her mother and later with her husband. In addition to the trips to England between\n1894 and 1896 while she was a student in London and in 1908 and 1912 for the mathe-\nmatical congresses in England and in Italy, it appears that she made several other voyages\nbetween 1905 and 1914 and nearly every year with her husband in the 1920s and 1930s.\nAfter the death of her husband in 1943, Williams moved from their townhouse on East\n63rd Street in New York City to the Hotel Pierre, also in Manhattan.\n\nIn 1952 Williams made her last trip to Europe, on the Queen Mary. After having frac-\ntured her hip on board ship in April, Emily Williams died at the American Hospital in\nParis in August 1952 at age seventy-eight. Her estate, which included a large amount of\nreal estate and was estimated at $12,000,000, was divided among her two godchildren and\ncharitable groups in New York City and Newport, Rhode Island. The New York organiza-\ntions included the New York Genealogical and Biographical Society, the Colonial Dames\nof America, the Marble Collegiate Church, and Peabody Home for Aged and Indigent\nWomen. The Rhode Island organizations included Trinity Church, the Redwood Library,\nthe Reading Room, and the Newport Historical Society.\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1896 [Coddington, E.

      "text": "BLANCH, Gertrude. February 2, 1897\u2013January 1, 1996.\nNew York University (BS 1932), Cornell University (MS 1934, PhD 1935).\n\nGertrude Blanch was born Gittel Kaimowitz in Kolno, Poland, which was then\nunder the control of Russia. She was the last of seven children of Dora (Blanc) and\nWolfe Kaimowitz (also \u201cKamovitz\u201d and \u201cKamowitz\u201d). Her father had emigrated\nfrom Poland to the United States early in the century, and he was joined by his\nwife, Gittel, and another daughter in 1907. Gittel attended public elementary and\nsecondary school in Brooklyn, New York, and graduated from the Eastern District\nHigh School at the beginning of 1914, the year her father died. By this time she\nhad Americanized her \ufb01rst name to Gertrude. In order to support her mother she\ntook a clerical job.\n\nGertrude Kaimowitz became a naturalized US citizen in 1921. After her mother\ndied in 1927, she decided to resume her education, so she enrolled in the Washington\nSquare College of New York University that year and began taking night courses.\nShe also decided to leave her job working for a hat dealer in increasingly responsible\npositions. However, her employer, Jacob Marks, o\ufb00ered to pay her tuition if she\nwould remain at the job; she accepted the o\ufb00er and graduated summa cum laude\nwith a major in mathematics and a minor in physics in 1932. Also in 1932, in\nFebruary, she legally changed her name to Gertrude Blanch, an Americanization of\nher mother\u2019s name Blanc. Later in 1932 she used the name Gertrude K. Blanch.\n\nWhen Blanch applied to graduate school at Cornell University, she used as one\nof her references Fay Farnum, who had earned her PhD in 1926 from Cornell as a\nstudent of Virgil Snyder and who had joined the faculty at New York University\njust before Blanch enrolled there. Blanch entered Cornell in September 1932 and\nreceived her master\u2019s degree in February 1934. She held a graduate scholarship her\n\ufb01nal year at Cornell and earned her PhD in 1935 after writing a dissertation in\ngeometry and with minors algebra and analysis.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD, Blanch returned to New York City and spent a year\nas a tutor at Hunter College replacing a faculty member on leave. She then took a\njob as a bookkeeper in Manhattan and, in order to remain mathematically active,\ntook an evening course in relativity at Brooklyn College. The instructor of the\ncourse was Arnold N. Lowan. When Lowan learned that she had a doctorate in\nmathematics he invited her to join the WPA project that he had been asked to\nhead. Although Blanch had no training in numerical analysis she had experience\nas an o\ufb03ce manager and with o\ufb03ce calculating machines. Thus, it was appropriate\nthat she was hired to supervise the training of high school graduates to make\nsophisticated mathematical tables using only pencil and paper. At the beginning of\n1938, Blanch became a mathematician for the Mathematical Tables Project in New\nYork. In a 1973 interview her colleague Ida Rhodes described Blanch\u2019s method of\nwriting detailed work sheets that could be followed one step at a time by people who\nhad no mathematical training. She claimed that Blanch \u201cdid accomplish miracles.\nThere is no doubt about that. It wasn\u2019t just the question of teaching those people,\nwho never heard [that numbers have signs, how to compute.] That was an important\nthing, but not her most important [deed.] The [crowning accomplishment] was the\nraising of the morale of these people who had [felt] rejected by society and [thought]\nthey were useless\u201d (Tropp interview, 2, square brackets in the original).\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBLANCH - 2\n\nBlanch worked for the project until 1942, spending the last two years as a tutor\nin the evening session of Brooklyn College. In 1942 she, along with many of the\nprofessional sta\ufb00 of the Mathematical Tables Project, became employees of the\nNational Bureau of Standards (NBS) contracted to the Applied Mathematics Panel\nof the National Defense Research Committee. During this period Blanch applied for\nand was denied security clearance based mainly on the fact that her sister, in whose\napartment she lived, was a member of the Communist Party. In 1946 Blanch was\ninvited to join the sta\ufb00 at Los Alamos but was again denied a security clearance\nand remained with the Mathematical Tables Project. The group continued working\nin New York and was disbanded after the war. In 1948 Blanch went to California,\nstill as an employee of NBS, as assistant director for computing at the Institute for\nNumerical Analysis (INA) located on the campus of UCLA. During the McCarthy\nera, she was again investigated, this time by a loyalty board of the Department of\nCommerce, which oversaw the NBS. David Alan Grier reports in his 2005 book that\na May 1952 \u201chearing resolved the charges against Blanch and allowed her to return\nto her job\u201d (308\u201309). With her loyalty no longer questioned, the following year she\nserved as a US representative to a symposium on automated digital computing held\nat the British National Physics Laboratory.\n\nAlthough Blanch was cleared of disloyalty, other employees of the INA remained\nunder attack, and the Institute closed in June 1954. Blanch left at the end of 1953\nand worked for the Electrodata Corporation, a section of the Consolidated Engi-\nneering Company in Pasadena, which was soon to be bought by the Burroughs Cor-\nporation. At the end of 1954 she became a senior mathematician at the Aerospace\nResearch Laboratories at the Wright Air Development Center (later Division) of\nWright-Patterson Air Force Base in Dayton, Ohio. At this time she was granted\nsecurity clearance.\n\nBlanch remained at Wright-Patterson until her retirement in 1967. She later\nsaid, \u201cI was never as happy in any other place as I was at Wright Field. I had\ncomplete freedom to do exactly what I wanted the way I wanted to do it and,\nI think, my best work was done there\u201d (Tropp interview 1973). The Air Force\nrecognized her accomplishments by awarding Blanch a Special Service Certi\ufb01cate\nin 1963 and a Senior Citizen Award the following year. Also during this period she\ncontinued her work on Mathieu functions and published extensively in this area,\nincluding the contribution on the subject to the 1964 NBS-sponsored Handbook of\nMathematical Functions. At the base she taught mathematics to o\ufb03cers needing\ntraining in aerodynamics. She was active in the Dayton branch of the AAUW and\nwas higher education chairman in at least 1963.\n\nStarting in the 1940s, Blanch made signi\ufb01cant contributions to many volumes of\ntables that do not bear her name as an author but were brought out by the WPA\nMathematical Tables Project and later by the National Bureau of Standards com-\nputation laboratory. While she was at INA and Wright AFB Blanch supervised the\ncomputations for many projects that resulted in publications or technical reports\nin which her assistance was acknowledged. In addition, she contributed to research\nin other ways by reviewing and assisting editors. Soon after the National Research\nCouncil journal Mathematical Tables and Other Aids to Computation was begun in\n1946, Blanch began contributing reviews to the section RMT (Recent Mathemat-\nical Tables). In 1955 the section became known as \u201cReviews and Descriptions of\nTables and Books,\u201d and Blanch continued to contribute reviews, as she did when\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBLANCH - 3\n\nthe journal changed its name to Mathematics of Computation in 1960. In the 1960s\nshe started contributing to the Mathematical Reviews; her forty-second and last\nreview appeared in 1987. In addition to refereeing for various journals, Blanch also\nserved as organizational representative from Wright Air Development Center to the\nSIAM Review during its \ufb01rst \ufb01ve years, 1959\u201363.\n\nOn March 3, 1964, Blanch received the Federal Woman\u2019s Award. The following\nyear, when the women\u2019s movement of the 1960s was just beginning, she noted in\nan article for the student journal of the NCTM that \u201cfrequently letters come to\nmy desk asking whether there is a place in mathematics for women,\u201d while others\nask if they can \u201chope to attain recognition, eventually\u201d (1965, 1). She answered\nby sketching the careers of Sonya Kovalevsky and Emmy Noether and ended her\narticle:\n\nAcceptance of minority groups\u2014women or other groupings\u2014comes\nwhen there is need for the service this group can render. The follow-\ning excerpt from Sonya Kovalevsky . . . is worth quoting: \u201cI received\n. . . an article by Strindberg, in which he proves, as decidedly as two\nand two make four, what a monstrosity is a woman who is professor\nof mathematics, and how unnecessary, injurious, and out of place\nshe is. I think he is right au fond; only I wish he would prove clearly\nthat there were plenty of mathematicians in Sweden better than I\nam and that it was only galanterie which made them select me!\u201d\n\nEven today, the man would probably be preferred by most em-\nployers over an equally competent woman. However, the prospects\nahead are for many more positions than there are applicants to \ufb01ll\nthem. In such a climate, there can be no e\ufb00ectual discrimination.\nThere is no essential handicap to a career by a women; we look for-\nward to a crop of women scientists, to perhaps disprove Strindberg\u2019s\njudgment of them. (1965, 4)\n\nAt her retirement in 1967 the Aerospace Research Laboratories published the\nBlanch Anniversary Volume: A Series of Papers Presented on the Occasion of her\nRetirement by the Friends of Gertrude Blanch. One of her closest colleagues, Ida\nRhodes, commenting on Blanch\u2019s receiving the Federal Woman\u2019s Award, said that\n\u201cif I had anything to do with awarding medals, I would have given her [one] made all\nof diamonds for the early work that she did, in welding a malnourished, dispirited\ncrew of people, coming from [the] Welfare Rolls, [into] a group that Leslie J. Comrie\nsaid was the \u2018mightiest computing team the world had ever seen\u2019 \u201d (Tropp interview\nwith Ida Rhodes 1973, 2, square brackets in the original).\n\nEven in retirement Blanch continued her involvement with mathematics beyond\nwriting reviews. Until 1970 she was an Air Force consultant through a contract\nwith Ohio State University. She then returned to California where, in 1973, she was\nwriting a book on numerical analysis for people who had computational experience\nbut did not understand the numerical processes involved. At that time she expected\nit to take her \ufb01ve years to \ufb01nish it. The unpublished manuscript is in her papers\nat the Charles Babbage Institute.\n\nGertrude Blanch died in San Diego on New Year\u2019s Day 1996, a month before her\n\nninety-ninth birthday.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, SIAM, AAAS (fellow), Phi Beta Kappa,\nAAUW.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBLANCH - 4\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1934 Number of representations by certain positive ternary quadratic forms.

November 18, 1895\u2013April 10, 1990.\nUniversity of Kansas (BA 1919, MA 1922, PhD 1926).\n\nWealthy Consuelo Babcock was born on a farm in Washington County, Kansas,\nnear the Nebraska border. She was the second child of Ella (Kerr) (b. 1872), a\nKansas native, and Cassius Lincoln Babcock (b. 1859), originally from Indiana.\nTheir son, Dale, was born in 1891, four years before Wealthy. In 1900 Cassius\nBabcock was a farmer; in 1910 the family was living in Hiawatha, in the northeast\ncorner of Kansas, and he was a carpenter. In 1920 Wealthy and her parents were\nliving in Steele City, Nebraska, just across the border from Washington County,\nKansas.\n\nWealthy Babcock graduated in 1913 from Washington County High School and\ntaught for one year at Liberty School followed by a year at Lone Mound, both one-\nroom country schools in Washington County. She then attended the University of\nKansas where she was a member of the women\u2019s basketball team, an early indication\nof her interest in sports. After receiving her BA in 1919, she taught for a year at\nNeodesha High School in southeastern Kansas.\n\nBabcock then returned to the University of Kansas, where she was to spend the\nrest of her career. She was an instructor starting in 1920, while also earning her\ngraduate degrees: a master\u2019s in 1922 and a doctorate with a minor in physics in\n1926. She was promoted to assistant professor in 1926 and to associate professor\nin 1940; she retired at that rank in 1966. During her tenure on the Kansas faculty\nBabcock regularly attended meetings of the Kansas Section of the MAA.\n\nAccording to G. Baley Price\u2019s 1975 history of the University of Kansas mathe-\nmatics department, she was known as an outstanding teacher. She was the depart-\nment\u2019s librarian for more than thirty years, and this contribution was acknowledged\nin 1966 by the naming of the Wealthy Babcock Mathematics Library. She served on\nmany committees on scholarships and awards and was particularly active in the KU\nAlumni Association\u2019s activities, for which she received the Fred Ellsworth Medal-\nlion, the highest award for service, in 1977. This honor was noted again in October\n2002 in the article \u201cOld Home Town \u2013 25, 40 and 100 Years Ago Today\u201d in the\nLawrence Journal-World. Scholarships that have been given in her name include\nthe Black\u2013Babcock mathematics scholarship, the Wealthy Babcock scholarship, the\nCharles H. Ashton\u2013Wealthy Babcock scholarship, and the Wealthy Babcock New\nStudent scholarship. A \ufb02oor of Templin Hall, a residence hall at the university, is\nnamed the Wealthy Babcock House.\n\nBabcock\u2019s career paralleled in many ways that of Florence Black, a close friend\nand colleague at the University of Kansas, with whom she shared many interests.\nBlack, too, received a PhD from Kansas in 1926 and was on the mathematics\nfaculty for her entire career. They were both avid sports fans, faithfully attending\nuniversity football and basketball games. In 2005 a columnist for the Lawrence\nJournal-World noted that \u201cI go back to the days when the likes of Florence Black,\nWealthy Babcock and Elizabeth Lawson knew as much about KU hoops as any\nliving creatures. They were \ufb01xtures in Hoch Auditorium and the \ufb01eldhouse for\neons.\u201d Both Babcock and Black were interested in camping and the out-of-doors.\nPrice notes that Babcock owned a stable of horses that she and Black rode. Both\nwere elected to the University of Kansas Women\u2019s Hall of Fame in 1973. The College\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBABCOCK - 2\n\nof Liberal Arts and Sciences reported in 2005 that the Florence Black and Wealthy\nBabcock Professorship in Mathematics was newly established.\n\nWealthy Babcock died at ninety-four at Presbyterian Manor in Lawrence, Kansas,\nin 1990. Survivors included a nephew, great-nephews and great-nieces, and great-\ngreat-nephews and great-great-nieces. She was cremated with inurnment in the\nPioneer Cemetery on the campus of the university.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi, Pi Mu Epsilon.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1922 On coaxial minors of determinants.

January 19, 1891\u2013May 17, 1967.\nRadcliffe College (BA 1913), Bryn Mawr College (MA 1923), University of\nIllinois (PhD 1930).\n\nElizabeth Morgan Cooper was born in Syracuse, New York, the eldest of six\nchildren of Jessie Marian (Bagg) (1866\u20131933) and Henry R. Cooper (1856\u20131928).\nHer mother, of Syracuse, and her father, of Woodbury, New Jersey, were married\nin Syracuse in 1889 and had three daughters followed by three sons. They were\nElizabeth, Mary (1892\u20131983), Margaret (1895\u20131986), James (1896\u20131968), Joseph\n(1900\u20131978), and Charles (1902\u20131987). It appears that all of the children later\ngraduated from either Radcli\ufb00e or Harvard. Her father was a Quaker and the man-\nager of the caustic soda department of the Solvay Process Company for more than\ntwenty years before his retirement in 1909. In 1910 he was described as a mechanical\nengineer. Her parents were active in the social life of Syracuse.\n\nCooper attended the Orchard School and the Goodyear Burlingame School, both\nprivate schools in Syracuse, before entering Radcli\ufb00e College in 1909, where she\nheld a scholarship all four years. She noted in her dissertation vita that she \u201cwas\nprivileged to have in most of her undergraduate work in mathematics, the patient,\ninspiring instruction of Professor Charles Leonard Bouton.\u201d She graduated magna\ncum laude in mathematics from Radcli\ufb00e in 1913.\n\nDuring the next seventeen years Cooper taught in private preparatory schools\nand earned her graduate degrees. She \ufb01rst taught at the Baldwin School in Bryn\nMawr, Pennsylvania, for fourteen years, 1913\u20131927. During 1920\u201323 she took grad-\nuate courses at Bryn Mawr College and received a master\u2019s degree in 1923, hav-\ning been a graduate scholar her last year there. During 1924\u201325 she had a leave\nof absence from the Baldwin School and read mathematics at Newnham College,\nCambridge University, England, on a fellowship from Radcli\ufb00e College. While there\nshe studied with J. E. Littlewood, among others. She studied at Radcli\ufb00e College\n1927\u201328. Cooper entered the University of Illinois in 1928, was an assistant 1929\u2013\n30, and wrote her dissertation in geometry before receiving her doctorate in 1930\nwith a minor in physics.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD, Cooper continued to work in private schools for the\nnext seven years. She was principal of the Buckingham School in Cambridge, Mas-\nsachusetts, from 1930 to 1935. In an obituary written for a school publication she\nwas described as the \u201cprincipal of Buckingham during the depths of the Depres-\nsion . . . [and] showed courage, clear-sighted practicality and humor, endearing her\nto sta\ufb00 and students alike.\u201d She was head of the mathematics department of the\nChapin School in New York before becoming supervisor of mathematics and teacher\ntraining at Hunter College and chairman of the mathematics department at Hunter\nCollege High School in 1937. She remained chairman of the department at Hunter\nHigh School until she retired in 1958. While at Chapin, Cooper wrote, but did not\npublish, a textbook that she called \u201cAlgebra for Anne.\u201d Later she worked on a\ntext called \u201cMathematics Made Plain\u201d and on an article explaining some of her\nphilosophy of teaching called \u201cMathematics for the Bright Student.\u201d\n\nAfter her retirement Cooper returned to Syracuse, where she taught some under-\ngraduate mathematics courses at Syracuse University and participated in teacher\ntraining seminars. The Buckingham obituary notes that after her retirement she\nalso served as \u201ca devoted tutor in mathematics to privileged and underprivileged\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nCOOPER - 2\n\nchildren alike. She was very much interested in anything that would promote better\nunderstanding among people of all races.\u201d This attitude was in keeping with her\ndeep involvement with the Quakers. Among her contributions as a life member of\nthe American Friends Service Committee was her service as director in summer\n1939 of Sky Island Hostel for European refugees at Nyack, New York. She was also\na a charter member and chairman of the management committee of a cooperative\nresidence club in New York, which she described in 1944 as a hostel for elderly\nrefugees. In 1948 it became Newark House of the New Jersey Fellowship Fund for\nthe Aged, and Cooper served as its president. She described herself as a Democrat\nand was also active in the Radcli\ufb00e Club of Syracuse.\n\nElizabeth Cooper died in her home in Syracuse, New York, at age seventy-six in\n\n1967.

September 27, 1878\u2013June 3, 1955.\nOberlin College (BA 1900), University of Chicago (MA 1903, PhD 1908).\n\nMary Emily Sinclair was the fourth of \ufb01ve children of Marietta S. (Fletcher)\n(1840\u20131913), a native of Worcester, Massachusetts, and John Elbridge Sinclair\n(1838\u20131915), who was born in New Hampshire. Her parents met when, in 1869, they\nreceived the two new faculty appointments at the Worcester County Free Institute\nof Industrial Science (Worcester Polytechnic Institute after 1887) in Massachusetts,\nthen a men\u2019s institution. The school had opened the previous year. Her mother,\nwho had studied in France and Germany, was hired to teach English and modern\nlanguages. Her father, recently widowed and the father of two young daughters,\narrived from Dartmouth College, where he had been on the mathematics faculty\nfor the previous six years as associate professor 1863\u201366 and full professor 1866\u2013\n69. He had received a BS from Dartmouth in 1858 and an MA from Washington\nUniversity in 1862 and had taught at Adrian College and Washington University.\nMarietta Fletcher and John Sinclair married in November 1870, and Marietta Sin-\nclair taught until 1872. Shortly thereafter their children were born; they were sons,\nHarry (1872\u20131934) and Luise Grant (1875\u20131950), and daughters, Alice (1876\u20131965),\nMary Emily, and Helen Melora (1880\u2013ca. 1968).

Sinclair, who\ninvented the ratchet wrench, remained on the faculty of Worcester Polytechnic In-\nstitute (WPI) for nearly forty years. The John E. Sinclair chair of mathematics,\nthe \ufb01rst endowed professorship at WPI, was established in 1915 with a gift from\nJohn Sinclair and his children. John Sinclair made the gift to \u201cshow a\ufb00ection for\nthe institute where in the early years Mrs. Sinclair and I taught together. . . \u201d (R.\nL. Norton, \u201cA Short History of Endowed Professorships at WPI\u201d).\n\nMary Emily Sinclair was born in Worcester, attended public schools there, and\ngraduated in 1896 from Worcester Classical High School. She then attended Ober-\nlin College and while there was a member of the LLS (Litterae laborum solanem,\npreviously Ladies Literary Society) and president of the college YWCA. After re-\nceiving her undergraduate degree in 1900, she maintained her membership in the\nLLS Alumnae Association.\n\nDuring 1900\u201301 Sinclair was an assistant teacher in Woodside Seminary, Hart-\nford, Connecticut. She then studied at the University of Chicago and received her\nmaster\u2019s degree in 1903. Her master\u2019s thesis was accompanied by a thread model of\na portion of the unbounded surface discussed in the thesis. Although the German\n\ufb01rm of Martin Schilling listed her model among its new mathematical models in\nthe December 1908 issue of the Bulletin of AMS (p. 147), no thread model appears\nto be extant. However, in 2003 a sculpture, \u201cQuintic Discriminant I,\u201d of a portion\nof the surface was carved by Helaman Ferguson and can be seen on the artist\u2019s\nwebsite.\n\nAfter receiving her master\u2019s degree, Sinclair taught in spring 1903 at Lake Erie\nCollege in Painesville, Ohio. During 1903\u201304 she held a fellowship at Chicago. The\nfollowing year she went to the University of Nebraska as an instructor and remained\nthere for three years.\n\nIn 1907 Sinclair was hired as an instructor at Oberlin College in Ohio, where she\nwas to serve on the faculty for thirty-seven years. She received her doctorate from\nthe University of Chicago in 1908, having written her dissertation in the calculus\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSINCLAIR - 2\n\nof variations under the direction of Oskar Bolza, and was promoted to associate\nprofessor at Oberlin.\n\nSinclair spent her \ufb01rst sabbatical year, 1914\u201315, at Columbia University and\nJohns Hopkins University. During that period she adopted two children, Margaret\nEmily in 1914 and Richard Elbridge in 1915. Both were born in New York and were\ninfants at the time of their adoption.\n\nSinclair spent the year 1922\u201323 as a Julia C. G. Piatt fellow of the AAUW,\n\ufb01rst at Cornell and then at Chicago. Her words of appreciation for this grant were\nquoted in a 1956 article in the AAUW journal. The year with this fellowship allowed\nSinclair to resume her research in the calculus of variations, and she presented four\npapers on that topic in late 1923. In 1925 she was promoted to professor and spent\na year\u2019s sabbatical in Rome and at the Sorbonne. In the summer of 1925, she visited\nin Freiburg with Oskar Bolza, her Chicago advisor, who had returned to Germany in\n1910. She spent the year 1927\u201328 on leave from Oberlin at the University of Miami,\nCoral Gables, Florida. It appears that her daughter, Margaret, was at that time\nattending the Exmoor School there, and in the 1930 census, her son, Richard, was\nlisted as a cadet at Miami Military Academy in Coral Gables. In spring 1935 she\nwas on leave at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey. In 1939\nshe became head of the department, and, except for spending the second semester\nof 1941\u201342 on leave at Columbia, she remained in that position until she retired as\nprofessor emeritus in 1944, having been named Clark professor of mathematics in\n1941. After retiring, she taught mathematics to Navy V-12 students part time at\nBerea College, Kentucky, 1944\u201346 and was listed in the Berea catalog as \u201cworker\nunder special agreement.\u201d\n\nSinclair was a charter member of the MAA and became active in the association\nsoon after its beginning in 1915. She served on the auditing committee 1917\u201319 and\nwas appointed librarian in 1918 and assistant librarian in 1922; she also held the\nlatter position at least in 1924 and 1925. In 1924 she was appointed to a committee\n\u201cto take under advisement the general problem as to how the Association can be of\nservice to departments of mathematics in the various colleges, and in particular to\nformulate standards to which departments of mathematics should conform\u201d (Amer.\nMath. Monthly 31 (1924): 166). Finally, she served as a member of the board of\ntrustees 1936\u201338.\n\nSoon after she retired from Oberlin, a Mary Emily Sinclair prize was established\nthere. A faculty committee awarded the prize based on papers delivered to the\ncollege mathematics club. In recognition of the support given her by the AAUW,\nSinclair contributed generously to their fellowship fund. She also contributed to\nOberlin to allow for the establishment of a loan fund for women to use for profes-\nsional reasons.\n\nAfter spending 1944\u201346 in Kentucky, Sinclair returned to Ohio. On May 12, 1950,\nMary Emily Sinclair was severely injured on the outskirts of Oberlin when she was\nbeaten by a seventeen-year-old youth who took her car. Accounts over several weeks\nin the Elyria, Ohio, Chronicle-Telegram describe the beating and subsequent events.\nShe su\ufb00ered a skull fracture and a broken nose after having been beaten about the\nhead with a heavy wire cutting tool. More than a month after the assault, she\ngave an account at the trial from a hospital cot accompanied by a nurse and two\nambulance attendants; the attacker was convicted of armed robbery and sentenced\nto ten to twenty years in a reformatory.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSINCLAIR - 3\n\nIn 1953 Sinclair moved to Belfast, Maine, where she made her home with her\ndaughter-in-law, Myrtle Sinclair. Mary Emily Sinclair died in a hospital in Belfast\nat age seventy-six in 1955. Among survivors listed were her daughter, two sisters,\nsix grandchildren, and several nieces and nephews.

      "text": "HSIA, Shu Ting (Liu). September 25, 1903\u2013August 16, 1980.\nUniversity of Michigan (BS 1926, MS 1927, PhD 1930).\n\nShu Ting Liu was born in Beijing, China, the eldest of several children of Shien-\nYing Chen and Te-Yuang Liu. In 1925 her father was described as a railroad en-\ngineer. One of her siblings was a foreign minister in the Taiwan government until\nafter 1967.\n\nApparently her precollege schooling, and possibly some university education, was\nobtained in Beijing before she came to the United States. It appears that she entered\nthe University of Michigan in Ann Arbor in 1923 and remained through August\n1929. In 1923 she listed as guardian Mrs. Heking, a former dean of Peking University,\nwho at the time was living in Ann Arbor. Shu Ting Liu attended Michigan as a\nholder of a Barbour Scholarship for Oriental Women, from a scholarship program\nfunded by Levi L. Barbour and established by the university in 1917 for women\nfrom Asia who planned to study medicine or education. At the same time, Barbour\ndonated money for the building of the Betsy Barbour dormitory for women, where\nLiu lived for at least two years as a graduate student. She was a member of the\nChinese Students Club at Michigan some years as an undergraduate and graduate\nstudent.\n\nShu Ting Liu earned a bachelor\u2019s degree in 1926, a master\u2019s degree in 1927, and\n\ufb01nished her work for the PhD in August 1929. In 1927 she was paid $75 to work as\nan assistant in the electrical engineering department. Despite the title of her PhD\ndissertation, \u201cTheory of periodic orbits for asteroids of integral types,\u201d her degree\nwas in mathematics; her dissertation gave \u201cthe construction of periodic solutions\nof the di\ufb00erential equations for the plane motion of an in\ufb01nitesimal body subject\nto the attraction of Jupiter and the Sun.\u201d The doctorate was conferred in March\n1930.\n\nLiu was a substitute instructor for an ill faculty member for two months in\n1929 at Colorado College in Colorado Springs. In December 1929, Liu married\nPin Fang (also \u201cPinfang\u201d) Hsia (1902\u20131970) in Colorado Springs. Hsia, born in\nAnhui Province in eastern China, attended Tsinghua University in Beijing before\ncoming to the United States as a Chung Hua scholar from Beijing and graduating\nfrom Colorado College and then from the Harvard Graduate School of Business\nAdministration in about 1929.\n\nIn April 1930, the Hsias were living in Detroit, Michigan, where he was working\nwith stocks and bonds. That summer they returned to China. In November 1930,\nShu Ting Liu Hsia reported to the Michigan alumni o\ufb03ce that she was a teacher\nin Shanghai College. On November 24, 1931, Yujen Edward, the \ufb01rst of their two\nchildren, was born in Shanghai. Their daughter, Lucia, was born June 9, 1937, also\nin Shanghai. Soon thereafter the family escaped to Hong Kong, presumably at the\ntime of the Battle of Shanghai, which began in August 1937. A short article in\nthe Colorado College Alumni News in December 1941 notes, \u201cMr. and Mrs. Hsia\nlost all their household furnishings . . . in a raid by the Japanese before the couple\nreturned to the United States\u201d (Colorado College Archives).\n\nIn August 1939, the Hsia family arrived in the United States, where they re-\nmained until 1946. During that period Pinfang Hsia was manager of the Bank of\nChina in New York. In 1944, Shu Ting Hsia reported that, in addition to caring\nfor her children, she was also engaged in teaching. She was listed as a temporary,\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHSIA - 2\n\npart-time instructor at Hunter College for the academic year 1944\u201345. In 1944 her\nhusband went to Canada to set up a branch o\ufb03ce.\n\nIn 1946 Pinfang Hsia was transferred to the branch in London, where he was\nresident manager of the Bank of China and was responsible for major expansion\ninto Europe. Shu Ting Hsia and Lucia returned to New York in 1950 after the\ngovernment changed in China. Yujen Edward Hsia was, at the time, a student at\nOxford University. Lucia Hsia attended Wells College and married in 1959; she\nlater divorced. Pinfang Hsia stayed on in London until the legal question of bank\nownership was resolved. He later became alienated from both the nationalist and\nCommunist headquarters of the Bank of China, submitted his resignation, and\nreturned to New York, where he worked for Magnus Mabee & Reynard, an oil \ufb01rm,\nuntil his retirement.\n\nAfter Shu Ting Hsia returned to New York, she did some statistical work for\nthe city of New York. Her application for a social security account number in 1957\nindicates that she was then working for the New York City Youth Board.\n\nPinfang Hsia died in New York in December 1970, a year after becoming a US\ncitizen. At the time of his death Y. Edward Hsia was an assistant professor of\ngenetics at Yale University, and Lucia Hsia Chinn was living in San Antonio. Y.\nEdward Hsia has since retired from the University of Hawaii, where he specialized\nin pediatrics and medical genetics; Lucia Chinn died in California in 1995.\n\nIn an e-mail to one of the authors in June 1998, Y. Edward Hsia wrote about his\nmother: \u201cMy mother . . . enjoyed working in mathematics, and I believe she enjoyed\nteaching, but her primary commitment must have been to establish a home for her\nfamily, which prevented her from pursuing a more formal career in mathematics.\nInterestingly, she was always interested in contract or tournament bridge and was\ntrying to become a master after she retired.\u201d He continued, \u201cMy mother was a\nrare example in her time of someone with a fairly classical Chinese upbringing \u2013 as\na woman \u2013 who took the exceptional course of venturing to [the] USA for higher\neducation, and was able to win a scholarship and earn a doctorate. She remained,\nhowever, a little uncomfortable with American mores and idiom.\u201d\n\nAfter her retirement Shu Ting Liu Hsia moved to New Haven, Connecticut.\nHaving been in ill health for some time, she died, possibly from aplastic anemia,\nat age seventy-six in West Haven, Connecticut, in 1980. In 1981 a gift of $8000\nwas made to the University of Michigan from the estate of Shu Ting Liu Hsia. A\nshare of this was to augment the Barbour scholarship fund, \u201cas an expression of\n[her] gratitude for the scholarship given to [her]\u201d (University of Michigan Alumni\nRecords O\ufb03ce).\nDissertation:\n1929 [Lui, S.

      "text": "HAYNES, Nola (Anderson). January 9, 1897\u2013December 21, 1996.\nUniversity of Missouri (BS 1922, MA 1926, PhD 1929).\n\nNola Lee Anderson was the second of \ufb01ve children of Mary Estella (Swan) (1866\u2013\n1946) and Edward Lee Anderson (1867\u20131945), a farmer. Her mother was born in\nMichigan, while her father, she, and her siblings were born in or near Bucklin in Linn\nCounty in north-central Missouri. Both parents had an elementary school education;\nthey were married in 1894. Nola Anderson\u2019s older sister, Mary Ellen (1895\u20131918),\nhad contracted polio when an infant. Her only brother, Morton Albert (1899\u20131967),\nreceived a high school education and became a farmer. Her younger sisters, Selma\nLucille (1909\u20131996) and Elma Peach (b. 1911), both received bachelor\u2019s degrees\nfrom the University of Missouri. Selma Anderson became a teacher and homemaker,\nwhile Elma Anderson received a second bachelor\u2019s degree in library science from\nthe University of Illinois and was a librarian.\n\nNola Anderson received her early education in a one-room schoolhouse and grad-\nuated from the high school in Bucklin in 1915. In 1981 she described her early\neducation. \u201cMy father would buy corn and ship cattle. He had me do a lot of the\nadding and \ufb01guring . . . and I liked it. I liked, of course, the arithmetic at school. I\nwent to a very small town high school that was just a two-year high school when\nI started. But they added on the junior year and the senior year . . . and I was in\nthe \ufb01rst [four-year] graduating class. . . . Then the pattern of the day was you took\nexaminations to get certi\ufb01cates and you could go out and teach in the rural schools.\nSo I did that and taught for four years at a rural school\u201d (Smithsonian meeting\ntapes).\n\nAnderson enrolled at the University of Missouri in the fall of 1919, at the age\nof twenty-two, and graduated three years later with a BS in education. She taught\nmathematics for two years at the high school in St. Charles, Missouri; the following\nyear she had charge of the mathematics department at Central College for Women,\na junior college in Lexington, Missouri. She then returned to the University of Mis-\nsouri to study mathematics and astronomy and received her MA after one year. She\ncontinued her graduate studies as a university scholar in mathematics in 1926\u201327,\nas a Gregory scholar in 1927\u201328, and as an instructor in 1928\u201329. Her dissertation\ncommittee consisted of her advisor, Louis Ingold, a 1907 Chicago PhD, and W. D.\nA. Westfall, G. E. Wahlin, and E. S. Haynes, who represented her minor \ufb01eld of\nastronomy. Anderson remained at the University of Missouri as an instructor for\none more year after receiving her doctorate in 1929.\n\nIn 1930 Anderson joined the faculty at H. Sophie Newcomb College, Tulane Uni-\nversity, in New Orleans as associate professor and acting chair of the department.\nShe remained for the next eight years as associate professor 1930\u201336 and as pro-\nfessor 1936\u201338; she also served as department chair during her years at Newcomb.\nIn her \ufb01rst years at Newcomb College, Anderson supervised a master\u2019s thesis in\ngeometry. She became active in the Louisiana-Mississippi Section of the MAA and\nserved as secretary 1931\u201332 and vice chairman for Louisiana 1937\u201338.\n\nWhen Anderson went to Newcomb in 1930, Anna Mayme Howe had just left\nafter eleven years as an assistant professor, and Marie J. Weiss had just arrived\nas an assistant professor. During 1934\u201335 Weiss was on leave to spend the year\nat Bryn Mawr College working with Emmy Noether, and Anderson hired Vera\nAmes (Widder) as her replacement for the year. In 1936 Weiss left for an assistant\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHAYNES - 2\n\nprofessorship at Vassar College, and Anderson hired M. Gweneth Humphreys as\nan instructor to replace Weiss. When Anderson left Newcomb in 1938, Marie Weiss\nreturned as professor and mathematics department head.\n\nWhile at Newcomb, Anderson remained in contact with E. S. Haynes, who had\nserved on her dissertation committee. Eli Stuart Haynes, born in Missouri in 1880,\nreceived his bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees from the University of Missouri in 1905\nand 1907, respectively, and his PhD in astronomy from the University of California\nin 1913. After nearly a decade at Beloit College he returned to the University of\nMissouri in 1923 as professor of astronomy and director of the Laws Observatory.\nAfter nearly twenty-six years of marriage and with two grown sons, Haynes was\nwidowed in 1934. Nola Anderson left Newcomb College at the end of the 1937\u201338\nschool year and married Haynes on July 9, 1938. Her marriage was announced in\nthe October 1938 issue of the Monthly.\n\nNola Anderson Haynes then moved to Columbia, Missouri. She described her\n\nexpectations and experiences there in 1981.\n\nWhen I left Newcomb College I left to get married to the chairman\nof the astronomy department of the University of Missouri. There\nwas a very strict nepotism law and I was giving up my career for\nmarriage, thinking I would never teach again. Then when the Sec-\nond World War came on . . . I was the \ufb01rst person called back into\nteaching. At that time they didn\u2019t set any salaries and they gave me\nthe name of acting instructor or something like that because of the\nnepotism law. I thought it was a temporary sort of thing and then\nafter the war the boys came back and I was still an acting associate\nprofessor . . . because of my husband. It was not until my husband\nretired that I got the appointment of associate professor. . . . There\nwas a very strict nepotism law at the University of Missouri; not\nonly did it include wives, but if you had a niece or a cousin on sta\ufb00\n- only one could be on the sta\ufb00. (Smithsonian meeting tapes)\n\nIn 1943\u201344 she was a special instructor; from 1946 to 1951 she served as acting\nassociate professor; and in 1951, after her husband\u2019s retirement in 1950, she became\nthe \ufb01rst woman at the University of Missouri to hold the title of associate professor\nof mathematics. In 1952 she was elected to a one-year term as secretary-treasurer\nof the Missouri Section of the MAA.

May 30, 1869\u2013July 27, 1951.\nWellesley College (BS 1890), Columbia University (MA 1899, PhD 1901).\n\nGrace Andrews was born in Brooklyn, New York, one of \ufb01ve children (four\ndaughters and a son) of Susan Matthews (Hotchkiss) (b. ca. 1827\u20131915), of Con-\nnecticut, and Edward Gayer Andrews (1825\u20131907), born in New York State. Her\nfather had studied at Cazenovia Seminary, graduated from Wesleyan University in\n1847, and was serving as pastor of a church in Cooperstown at the time of her par-\nents\u2019 marriage in 1851. Later he was brie\ufb02y president of Mans\ufb01eld Female College\nin Ohio, was principal of Cazenovia Seminary, and in 1872 became a bishop of the\nMethodist Episcopal Church. The three surviving siblings of Grace were Winifred\n(b. ca. 1856), born in Ohio, and Helen (b. ca. 1859) and Edward (b. ca. 1863),\nboth born in New York. From 1872 to 1880 the family was living in Des Moines,\nIowa, and from 1880 to 1888 they were in Washington, D.C. In connection with her\nfather\u2019s extended trip to India, Grace, her brother, and her mother spent about six\nmonths in Europe in 1877.\n\nGrace Andrews was educated at the Mount Vernon Seminary (later a college for\nwomen and now a women\u2019s campus of George Washington University) in Wash-\nington, D.C., before going to Wellesley College. She entered Wellesley in 1885 as\na member of the class of 1889 and, having taken the \ufb01ve-year course with music,\ngraduated in 1890. While at Wellesley she was a member of Zeta Alpha, a literary\nand theatrical society on campus. She began graduate work at Columbia Univer-\nsity in October 1897 and earned a master\u2019s degree in 1899 and a PhD in 1901.\nNo advisor is indicated in the records. From 1900 to 1902 Andrews served as an\nassistant in mathematics at Barnard College. She reported to Wellesley that during\nthe \ufb01rst year she was teaching two classes, one freshman level and one elective, and\nhad light duties the second year. She was living in Manhattan when she joined the\nAMS in December 1901 and remained at the same address through at least 1903,\nafter which she moved to her family\u2019s home in Brooklyn. She continued to live with\nher mother after her father\u2019s death in 1907 and remained in the family home until\nher mother\u2019s death in 1915.\n\nFrom 1905 to 1926 Grace Andrews was an accountant to the treasurer at Wes-\nleyan University, work she was able to do while living in Brooklyn. She noted in\n1909 that she was going to be taking a course in accounting. From 1916 until her\ndeath she had responsible positions with the New York branch of the Women\u2019s\nForeign Missionary Society of the Methodist Episcopal Church, serving at various\ntimes as home base secretary, receiving treasurer, treasurer, chairman of the \ufb01nance\ncommittee, and director.\n\nAlthough she was not employed as a mathematician after 1902, Grace Andrews\nattended about two AMS meetings a year in New York City through 1907 and\nremained a member of the society until about 1918. Andrews was a member of\nthe Brooklyn Botanic Garden; the New York Wellesley Club; the Kosmos Club of\nBrooklyn, where she was treasurer and director; and the Women\u2019s University Club\nof New York. She liked to travel and spent about a month every summer out of the\ncity, frequently in the nearby mountains. She was an avid reader and fond of doing\ndouble crostic puzzles. Although she lived alone after the death of her mother, she\nhad many nieces and nephews in the vicinity and was involved with her extended\nfamily.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nANDREWS, G. - 2\n\nGrace Andrews died at eighty-two in 1951 in Margaretville, New York, near\nwhere she had frequently visited in the summers.

She was\nborn in Hamilton, Ontario, Canada, where at the time of the 1881 Canadian census\nher father\u2019s occupation was described as collector. At that time, \ufb01ve children in the\nhousehold were listed: James, 23; Richard, 22, a teacher; Alice, 20; Sam, 15; and\nLouisa, 10.\n\nLouise\u2019s brother Richard earned a BA from the University of Toronto in 1878\nand became a physician in Wayne, Michigan. Alice was a pianist who taught at one\ntime at St. Margaret\u2019s College for Ladies, a private high school in Toronto. Samuel,\nwho graduated in medicine from Toronto with an MB in 1888, became a surgeon\nwho was noted for his pioneering work with X-rays for the diagnosis and treatment\nof medical problems.\n\nLouise Cummings attended public schools and the Hamilton Collegiate Institute\nin Hamilton, Ontario, before being admitted to the University of Toronto in 1889.\nAfter attending in 1889\u201390, she was away for a year. In 1891\u201392, she returned to\nToronto as a second-year student and remained 1892\u201393 as a third-year student.\nShe was not in attendance 1893\u201394 but was a fourth-year student in 1894\u201395. She\nwon the William Mulock scholarship in mathematics her second year and half of\nthe physics scholarship her third year. Cummings received her bachelor\u2019s degree\nfrom Toronto in 1895 with \ufb01rst class honors in mathematics.\n\nCummings spent most of the next \ufb01ve years in graduate study in mathematics\nat four di\ufb00erent institutions. Although she was not listed as a graduate student,\nshe continued her study at Toronto in 1895\u201396 under the direction of Alfred T.\nDeLury, who was later to become head of the department. The next year, 1896\u201397,\nshe held a Bennett fellowship, one of two given annually to women in the graduate\nschool (then called the department of philosophy) for study at the University of\nPennsylvania. In 1897\u201398 she was a student at the University of Chicago, and the\nfollowing year she was a resident fellow in mathematics at Bryn Mawr College. She\nsupervised examinations at Toronto in 1897 and held a fellowship by courtesy in\nmathematics during the second semester of 1899\u20131900 at Bryn Mawr. During her\n\ufb01rst year at Bryn Mawr she gave two presentations, on Galois \ufb01elds and on graphical\nrepresentation of groups, to the Mathematical Journal Club. Other speakers for the\nyear included professors Scott and Harkness of Bryn Mawr and Morley of Haverford,\nand four students, including Grace Bareis and Emilie Norton Martin.\n\nCummings studied at the Ontario Normal College in Hamilton during the year\n1900\u201301. She returned to Toronto in 1901 to continue her studies and to teach\nmathematics at St. Margaret\u2019s. Her master\u2019s degree was awarded by the University\nof Toronto in 1902.\n\nIn the fall of 1902, Cummings joined the faculty at Vassar College in Pough-\nkeepsie, New York, where she remained until her retirement more than thirty-three\nyears later. The other new member of the Vassar mathematics department that year\nwas Elizabeth B. Cowley. While there Cummings was instructor 1902\u201315, assistant\nprofessor 1915\u201319, associate professor 1919\u201327, professor 1927\u201335, and professor\nemeritus after her retirement.

She received her doctorate from Bryn Mawr in 1914\nwith subjects mathematics, applied mathematics, and physics. Both Henry Seely\nWhite of Vassar and Charlotte A. Scott of Bryn Mawr had a role in her dissertation\nwork. White, who had earned his PhD at G\u00a8ottingen in 1891, came to Vassar as\nprofessor in 1905 and remained until his retirement in 1936. In her dissertation\nvita Cummings acknowledges her indebtedness to Scott \u201cfor helpful criticism and\nunfailing interest in the preparation of this paper\u201d and to White \u201cwho suggested\n. . . the subject of [the] dissertation.\u201d She published a dozen papers over twenty years,\nand her work is discussed in Hutchinson\u2019s 1977 article, \u201cWomen in Combinatorics.\u201d\nTwo of her papers were coauthored with White, who was president of the AMS\n1907\u201308, and Frank Nelson Cole, who was secretary of the AMS 1896\u20131920. This\nwork was mentioned by E. T. Bell in his article on algebra in the Semicentennial\nAddresses of the American Mathematical Society and in T. S. Fiske\u2019s 1927 obituary\nof Cole in which he notes that \u201cMiss Cummings developed the earliest examples\u201d\nof a certain type (p. 775).\n\nCummings attended many meetings of the AMS and MAA and often gave pre-\nsentations at the AMS meetings. In 1924 she was appointed to the MAA committee\nto formulate the details for awarding the newly established Chauvenet prize. She\nalso attended the International Congress of Mathematicians (ICM) in Toronto in\n1924 and in Zurich in 1932. She was given an honorary DSc degree by the Uni-\nversity of Toronto at the university\u2019s centennial celebration in 1927. The Carnegie\nFoundation granted her a retiring allowance beginning February 24, 1936.\n\nAfter su\ufb00ering from severe arthritis for several years, Louise Cummings died in\n1947 at the age of seventy-six at the home of her niece in Wayne, Michigan.

      "text": "GRAY, Marion C. March 26, 1902\u2013September 16, 1979.\nUniversity of Edinburgh (MA 1922), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1926).\n\nMarion Cameron Gray was born in Ayr, Scotland, the daughter of Marion\n(Cameron) and James Gray. She attended Ayr Grammar School (1907\u201313) and\nAyr Academy (1913\u201319) before matriculating at the University of Edinburgh in\n1919. At the time of her matriculation she indicated that she was a member of the\nUnited Free Church of Scotland.\n\nIn 1922 Gray received her master\u2019s degree, the \ufb01rst degree given in universities\nin Scotland at that time, with \ufb01rst class honors in mathematics and natural phi-\nlosophy. She remained at Edinburgh another two years as a post-graduate student\nin mathematics. While at Edinburgh she studied with E. T. Whittaker, whom she\ncredited with \ufb01rst arousing her interest in mathematics.\n\nGray came to the United States in 1924 to study at Bryn Mawr College. At Bryn\nMawr she held a British graduate scholarship and a Carnegie research scholarship.\nWhile at Bryn Mawr, she studied with Anna Pell Wheeler, David V. Widder, Mar-\nguerite Lehr in mathematics and James Barnes in physics before receiving her PhD\nin 1926 having written a dissertation in analysis and with allied subject physics. In\nDecember 1925, Barnes had written a letter of recommendation to the president of\nthe University of Saskatchewan indicating that Gray was hoping to remain in the\nUnited States or Canada.\n\nAfter receiving her doctorate, Gray returned to Great Britain, where she was a\nuniversity assistant in natural philosophy at the the University of Edinburgh for one\nyear and an assistant in mathematics at the Imperial College of Science in London\nfor three years.\n\nIn 1930 she returned to the United States and was hired as an assistant engineer\nin the development and research department of American Telephone and Telegraph\nCompany. She published two papers relevant to her work in the journal Physics,\nlater to become the Journal of Applied Physics. In about 1932 she discovered what\nhas become known as the Gray graph while \u201clooking for what we called completely\nsymmetric networks\u201d (Gray to Bouwer, July 10, 1969). Although she never pub-\nlished anything about this graph, Izak Z. Bouwer learned of her work on the graph\nand mentioned it in his 1968 paper \u201cAn edge but not vertex transitive cubic graph\u201d\n(Canad. Math. Bull. 11:533\u201335). In June 1969, he wrote to Gray of his \u201capprecia-\ntion of the fact that at a time when graph theory was almost nonexistent, you had\nalready found this graph with its interesting properties.\u201d The graph is discussed\nin \u201cGray Graph\u201d from Wolfram MathWorld by Eric W. Weisstein, and in \u201cGray\nGraph\u201d from Wikipedia, The Free Encyclopedia.\n\nIn 1934 she joined the technical sta\ufb00 of Bell Telephone Laboratories where she\nworked for more than thirty years, \ufb01rst in New York City and then in Murray Hill,\nNew Jersey. While there, Gray published several more articles and contributed to\nthe \ufb01eld of mathematical physics in other ways as well. In addition to writing\nbook reviews in journals, she aided other authors and was acknowledged for her\nhelpful discussions and for her computations. She also wrote 258 reviews in the\n\ufb01rst fourteen volumes of Mathematical Reviews. In 1954 Gray served on an ad\nhoc committee formed when the National Science Foundation asked the National\nBureau of Standards (now the National Institute of Standards and Technology) to\nprepare a handbook of mathematical tables. The outcome of that project was the\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGRAY, M. C. - 2\n\nHandbook of Mathematical Functions with Formulas, Graphs, and Mathematical\nTables published in 1964. For her entry in the twelfth edition of American Men\nand Women of Science, she indicated her research interests as wave propagation\nover the spherical earth, mathematical theory of antenna radiation, propagation\nof waves in loaded wave guides, and numerical analysis. One hundred forty of her\nreviews in MR were classi\ufb01ed as \u201coptics, electromagnetic theory, circuits,\u201d while\nanother 52 were classi\ufb01ed as \u201cspecial functions.\u201d\n\nIn the 1930s, Gray lived in New York City and later in East Orange, New Jersey.\nShe became a naturalized United States citizen in 1937. After her retirement in\n1967, Gray returned to Edinburgh, where she died at age seventy-seven in 1979.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Edinburgh Math. Soc., London Math.

      "text": "BAKER, Frances E. December 19, 1902\u2013April 4, 1995.\nUniversity of Iowa (BA 1923, MS 1925), University of Chicago (PhD 1934).\n\nFrances Ellen Baker was born in Anna, Illinois, the elder of two daughters\nof Katherine (Riedelbauch) (1868\u20131952) and Richard Philip Baker (1866\u20131937).\nFrances Baker\u2019s mother was born in Glasford, near Peoria, Illinois, and attended\nthe Peoria county schools. She studied music privately and, except when she was\nattending college, was a private teacher of piano and voice as well as a choir direc-\ntor at intervals from 1890 to 1898. She earned a diploma in music from the School\nof Music at Illinois Wesleyan University in 1897 and was instructor of piano and\nmusic and head of the music department at Lamar College (now closed) in Lamar,\nMissouri, from 1898 to 1901.\n\nBaker\u2019s father, born in Shropshire, England, received his undergraduate educa-\ntion at Oxford University and at the University of London, from which he received\na bachelor\u2019s degree in 1887. In 1888 he moved to Texas and taught music and in a\nsecondary school while he studied law. In early 1891 he was admitted to the Texas\nbar and practiced law there until 1894. He then studied mathematics at the Uni-\nversity of Chicago 1894\u201396, except for the fall term of 1895 when he taught in the\nmusic department of the University of Oregon. During his \ufb01rst year at Chicago he\nalso read entrance examination papers in Latin and Greek and was organist and\ndirector of a choir. According to Frances Baker, he was awarded a fellowship in\nmathematics at Chicago for 1896\u201397 but did not accept because the \u201cstipend [was]\ninsu\ufb03cient to live on.\u201d Instead, he taught mathematics, chemistry, and physics at\nthe Kenosha Boys\u2019 School in Wisconsin. From 1897 to 1901, R. P. Baker was pres-\nident, and head of science and mathematics, of Lamar College, where presumably\nhe met his future wife.\n\nIn 1901 Baker\u2019s father became co-principal and head of science and mathematics\nat Union Academy, a private secondary school in Anna, in southwestern Illinois. On\nFebruary 22, 1902, Katherine Riedelbauch and Richard Philip Baker were married\nin Glasford, Illinois. The Bakers made their \ufb01rst trip to England in the summer\nof 1903 to introduce their new daughter, Frances, born in December 1902, to her\nEnglish grandparents. R. P. Baker remained at Union Academy until 1904; during\n1903\u201304 Katherine Baker taught elementary German there. The Bakers spent the\nnext year in Chicago, where R. P. Baker was head chemist at R. R. Donnelly,\na printing company. For many years R. P. Baker had constructed mathematical\nmodels, which he considered essential for teaching geometry. In January 1905 he\nhad printed a catalog of a hundred models he had made and was selling. Many of\nhis models are currently in the mathematical collections of the National Museum\nof American History, Smithsonian Institution, and of the University of Arizona.\n\nIn the fall of 1905 R. P. Baker began a thirty-two year association with the math-\nematics department of the State University of Iowa (commonly referred to as the\nUniversity of Iowa). He was instructor from 1905 to 1910, when he earned his PhD\nin mathematics from the University of Chicago with a dissertation directed by E. H.\nMoore. Baker was assistant professor 1910\u201315 and then associate professor until his\ndeath in 1937. Katherine Baker continued to give private lessons in piano and voice\nfrom 1906 until 1926. The Bakers established and played with the \ufb01rst chamber\nmusic ensemble in Iowa City. The Bakers\u2019 other daughter, Gladys Elizabeth, was\nborn in Iowa City in July 1908.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBAKER - 2\n\nFrances Baker received her elementary education from her parents. She wrote\nin 1985, \u201cMy father gave me signi\ufb01cant mathematical instruction and guidance\nfrom age 10 onward. Before that age I owe [my] earliest mathematical training to\nmy mother, especially in arithmetic and music\u201d (Smithsonian questionnaire). Her\nmother also taught her German, and Gladys Baker reported later that \u201cFrances\nwas already an accomplished pianist when she entered high school in 1915\u201d and\nthat \u201cher German was good enough so that later in the University she could enroll\nin a third year class\u201d (Gladys Baker, Biographical Notes). She attended public\nhigh school in Iowa City, was active with the school newspaper and yearbook, and\ngraduated as valedictorian of her class in 1919.\n\nFrances Baker did her undergraduate studies and two years of graduate work at\nthe University of Iowa. She entered the university in 1919, before her seventeenth\nbirthday. After losing a semester\u2019s work early in 1920 because of the Spanish in-\n\ufb02uenza, she made up the credits in summer school and graduated magna cum laude\nin 1923, having been elected to Phi Beta Kappa her junior year. She studied Latin\nand Greek as well as mathematics and won both the Latin and Greek prizes her\nsenior year. As an undergraduate Baker was active in the Classics Club, was a mem-\nber of the Iowa women\u2019s debating team, and was elected to Delta Sigma Rho, an\nhonorary debating society. Her sister, Gladys, wrote later that \u201cit was di\ufb03cult for\nher to decide on a major subject as she was an all-round scholar but \ufb01nally settled\non Mathematics because that was what she wished to teach\u201d (Gladys Baker, Bio-\ngraphical Notes). Frances Baker wrote in 1985, \u201cA strong motivating factor from\nmy senior year, 1922\u20131923, was awareness of the historical development of Mathe-\nmatics through such works as Cassius J. Keyser\u2019s book Mathematical Philosophy\u201d\n(Smithsonian questionnaire). For the next two years, she worked for her master\u2019s\ndegree, studying mainly under the direction of her father. During her last year she\nheld a graduate fellowship and taught a freshman mathematics course for one se-\nmester, before receiving a master\u2019s degree in 1925 with work in mathematics and\nphysics.\n\nAfter earning her master\u2019s degree Baker spent most of the next six years teaching,\nwith some graduate study in mathematics. She was an instructor of mathematics\nand physics and head of the department at Tabor College in Tabor, Iowa, 1925\u2013\n27. While there she taught mathematics courses through calculus as well as year\ncourses with laboratories in college physics and inorganic chemistry. Because of \ufb01-\nnancial di\ufb03culties Tabor College closed in 1927, and Baker held a similar position\nat Je\ufb00erson City Junior College in Missouri 1927\u201328. During the summer of 1928,\nshe and Gladys made a trip to Europe and included a visit with an aunt in Eng-\nland. After deciding she would not return to Je\ufb00erson City, Frances enrolled at the\nUniversity of Iowa for one semester to earn a teaching certi\ufb01cate. She then attended\nthe University of Chicago for two quarters in 1929, beginning in the spring quarter.\nFrom 1929 to 1931 she was instructor of mathematics and head of the department\nat the Creston, Iowa, Junior College and Senior High School.\n\nFrances Baker returned to the University of Chicago in 1931, held a fellowship\n1932\u201333, and taught a freshman course in the spring quarter of that year. She\nreceived her PhD in March 1934 with a dissertation directed by L. E. Dickson on the\nWaring problem for cubic functions. Although she did not publish her dissertation,\nit was cited in several articles published in 1934.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBAKER - 3\n\nThe education of her younger sister, Gladys Elizabeth Baker, was similar, but\nin botany rather than mathematics. Gladys Baker also earned a bachelor\u2019s degree\nand a master\u2019s degree at the University of Iowa, in 1930 and 1932, respectively. She\ncontinued her graduate work in botany and mycology at Washington University in\nSt. Louis and received her doctorate in 1935. She taught at Hunter College 1936\u201340\nand at Vassar College 1940\u201363 and was chairman of the plant science department\nat Vassar 1948\u201360. She taught at the University of Hawaii at Manoa for most of\nthe next decade until her retirement in 1973.\n\nFrances Ellen Baker lived at home in Iowa City during the \ufb01rst semester 1934\u201335\nand was an instructor at Vassar College during the spring semester 1934\u201335, while\nLouise D. Cummings was on leave. In the fall of 1935 she went to Mount Holyoke\nCollege, from where Emilie Martin had just retired after nearly thirty years on the\nfaculty. Baker remained at Mount Holyoke for the next seven years as instructor\n1935\u201340 and assistant professor 1935\u201342. She had a leave in the fall semester 1938,\nhaving been injured in an automobile accident, and was replaced for that semes-\nter by Mary Barbara Haberzetle (Turner), who had just received her doctorate\nfrom Chicago. While at Mount Holyoke Baker taught courses from analytic geom-\netry through calculus, history of mathematics, modern geometry, probability and\nstatistics, and theory of equations; and she directed three honors papers.\n\nIn 1942 Baker joined her sister, Gladys, at Vassar College and spent the rest of\nher career there. She was hired as associate professor, was promoted to professor\nin 1951, and retired as emeritus professor in 1968. She later mentioned as positive\nin\ufb02uences Henry S. White, a former president of the AMS who was at Vassar\n1905\u201336, and Mary E. Wells who was on the faculty at Vassar from 1915 until her\nretirement in 1948. Wells had become department chair when White retired.\n\nBaker directed several honors papers at Vassar in addition to teaching mathe-\nmatics courses. She chaired the Vassar department 1948\u201350 and 1951\u201352. She had\nthree research leaves while at Vassar. During the second and third terms of 1945\u201346\nshe was an honorary fellow at the University of Wisconsin; she spent the academic\nyear 1952\u201353 at Princeton University; and she spent the year 1960\u201361 at the Uni-\nversity of North Carolina. She also spent the summer of 1953 at the University of\nCalifornia at Berkeley.\n\nIn 1943 and 1944 Baker gave talks at Rutgers University and at McGill University\non the mathematical models her father had constructed forty years earlier. She also\ngave talks on topics in the history of mathematics at Hollins College in 1947, at\nHobart and William Smith Colleges in 1952, at the University Club in Sun City,\nArizona, in 1978, and at a meeting of the Southwestern Section of the MAA at\nNorthern Arizona University in 1980. Starting a few years before her retirement,\nshe became a frequent book reviewer for the library journal Choice and reviewed\ntwenty-\ufb01ve books, more than half in probability or statistics, from 1964 through\n1974.\n\nAt Vassar, Baker was a member of the Science Club 1942\u201348 and the local chap-\nters of Phi Beta Kappa and Sigma Xi. She served as treasurer, on the membership\ncommittee, and as president of the Vassar Phi Beta Kappa chapter. In 1957\u201358 and\n1966\u201367 she was president of the Vassar Sigma Xi chapter. She was a member of\nthe History of Science Society from 1940 until 1968 and was a member of the New\nYork Academy of Sciences from 1964 until the early 1970s. Baker was a member of\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBAKER - 4\n\nthe Protestant Episcopal church. She described her interests as reading, music, and\ntravel.\n\nIn January 1974, Gladys Baker moved to Sun City, Arizona, just outside Phoenix,\nand Frances Baker moved to a separate home there that autumn. While there\nFrances read college mathematics books for Recordings for the Blind. As her health\nworsened in the mid-1980s, she moved into intermediate care facilities, and in No-\nvember 1989 she moved to the Plaza del Rio Care Center in nearby Peoria, Arizona,\nwhere she lived until her death at age ninety-two in 1995. Services were held in Iowa.\nShe was survived by her sister, Gladys, who died in Arizona in 2007, just after her\nninety-ninth birthday.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, IMS, Hist. Sci.

      "text": "KRAMER, Edna E. May 11, 1902\u2013July 9, 1984.\nHunter College (BA 1922), Columbia University (MA 1925, PhD 1930).\n\nEdna Ernestine Kramer was born in New York, New York, the eldest of three\nchildren of Sabine (Elowitch) (1879\u20131958) and Joseph Kramer (1869\u20131949). Her\nparents were born in Austria-Hungary and emigrated from there in 1886 and 1882,\nrespectively. They had high school educations and were married in 1901. Her mother\nwas a housewife and her father a salesman of men\u2019s clothing. Her younger sister,\nMartha H., born in 1904, graduated from Hunter College and was later a French\nteacher; her brother, Herbert E., born in 1911, had a BA and an MA from Columbia\nCollege and was a chemistry teacher. Both were elected to Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nKramer attended Wadleigh High School in Manhattan and graduated in 1918 at\nage sixteen. She later credited Dr. John A. Swenson, her \ufb01rst mathematics teacher\nat Wadleigh, with in\ufb02uencing her choice of mathematics as a career. She then\nattended Hunter College from which she graduated summa cum laude, \ufb01rst in her\nclass, in 1922. In 1922\u201323 she taught at DeWitt Clinton High School in the Bronx,\nand in 1923\u201329 she taught at Wadleigh High School, while also doing graduate work\nat Columbia University. In her dissertation vita she expressed her indebtedness to\nSwenson, of Wadleigh, \u201cfor the interest in her which prompted him to arrange her\nprogram of teaching so as to make it possible for her to attend courses at Columbia\nUniversity.\u201d She earned her master\u2019s degree in 1925 and her PhD in 1930 with a\nminor in physics.\n\nKramer, with the recommendation of Swenson, obtained a position at Montclair\nState Teachers College (now Montclair State University) in New Jersey in 1929. She\nremained there \ufb01ve years: as instructor 1929\u201332 and as assistant professor 1932\u201334.\nIn 1934 she published notes that became her \ufb01rst book, A First Course in Educa-\ntional Statistics, and she moved to Thomas Je\ufb00erson High School in Brooklyn as\nteacher and chairman of the mathematics department. The following year, on July\n2, 1935, Kramer married Benedict Taxier Lassar, teacher of French and guidance\ncounselor at Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn. Lassar, born in New York\nCity in 1906, had received a BA from CCNY, a JD from Columbia, and a Certi\ufb01cat\nd\u2019Etudes Francaises from the University of Grenoble. He later received a master\u2019s\ndegree from Columbia and a PhD in clinical psychology from New York University.\nHe remained at Abraham Lincoln High School until 1962. He was also self-employed\nand, from 1964, was a sta\ufb00 psychologist at a psychotherapy center.\n\nEdna Kramer-Lassar remained at Thomas Je\ufb00erson High School from 1934 un-\ntil 1956. During this period she did further study, held several other professional\npositions, and was engaged in historical research and writing. She studied at the\nCenter for Research and Graduate Education in Mathematics (later Courant Insti-\ntute of Mathematical Sciences), New York University, 1939\u201340 and at the Univer-\nsity of Chicago in 1941. She was instructor in the graduate division at Brooklyn\nCollege 1935\u201338; mathematics consultant in statistics for the US O\ufb03ce of Scien-\nti\ufb01c Research and Development, the Division of War Research, Research Group,\nColumbia University 1943\u201345; instructor at Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn (now\nPolytechnic University) 1948\u201353; and instructor in the graduate division at New\nYork University 1949\u201350. In 1942, during its second year, Kramer served as the\nvice chairman of the Metropolitan New York Section of the MAA. During the war\nher research on anti-aircraft \ufb01re control was classi\ufb01ed. Her \ufb01rst book in history of\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nKRAMER - 2\n\nmathematics, The Main Stream of Mathematics, was published by Oxford Univer-\nsity Press in 1951. In 1952 it was chosen by the Book Find Club, an alternative to\nthe Book-of-the-Month Club; it subsequently underwent a number of editions and\nwas translated into Italian, Dutch, and Japanese.\n\nIn 1956 Kramer-Lassar left Thomas Je\ufb00erson High School. That year she traveled\nto England, France, Italy, and Switzerland to interview the women mathematicians\nwho were the subjects of her 1957 article, \u201cSix More Female Mathematicians,\u201d\nwritten in response to Julian L. Coolidge\u2019s 1951 Scripta Mathematica article, \u201cSix\nFemale Mathematicians.\u201d She also wrote a survey of mathematics for the Encyclo-\npedia Hebraica, published in Jerusalem 1956\u201357.\n\nKramer continued her teaching at Brooklyn Polytech as adjunct professor from\n1953 until 1971, when she retired with emeritus rank. She was a consultant on\na special project supported by the NCTM for the University of Oregon in 1963\nand participated in the writing of the resulting ten-unit series \u201cExperiences in\nMathematical Discovery\u201d published by the NCTM in 1966. From 1965 to 1969 she\ndid further study at NYU\u2019s Institute of Mathematical Sciences (renamed Courant\nInstitute of Mathematical Sciences in 1966), and in 1970 her book The Nature and\nGrowth of Modern Mathematics \ufb01rst appeared. It, too, underwent a number of\nlater editions and was chosen as a Library of Science Book Club selection. In the\nearly 1970s, she wrote almost all of the biographies of women mathematicians that\nappeared in the Dictionary of Scienti\ufb01c Biography. In 1972 she was a consultant\nto a committee looking to place women mathematicians in Ivy League universities,\nand the following year she was lecturer at Nanyang University in Singapore. She\nwas a member of the New York Academy of Sciences. Kramer\u2019s interests included\nmusic and travel. Also in 1973 she was honored by election to the Hunter College\nHall of Fame, which had been established the previous year.\n\nEdna Kramer-Lassar had developed Parkinson\u2019s disease and su\ufb00ered from a bro-\nken hip more than two years before her death from pneumonia in her home in\nManhattan at age eighty-two in 1984. She was survived by her husband, her sister,\nand several nieces and nephews.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, AWM, Soc. Math. France, AAAS, Hist.

      "text": "M\n\nMADDISON, Isabel. April 13, 1869\u2013October 22, 1950.\nUniversity of London (BSc 1893), Bryn Mawr College (PhD 1896), Trinity\nCollege (Dublin) (BA 1905).\n\nAda Isabel Maddison was born in Whitehaven, a seaport town in Cumberland,\nthe most northwestern county in England. She was the daughter of Mary Jane\n(Anderson), born in about 1829 in Ireland, and John Maddison, born in about\n1826 in Durham, England. Her father was a civil servant. British census records\nindicate that Isabel Maddison was probably the youngest of four children. The\nothers were Anne (b. 1853), Jane (b. 1854), and William Thomas (b. ca. 1859). In\n1871 the family was living in Whitehaven, where it appears that John Maddison was\na parish supervisor, and in 1881 they were in Cardi\ufb00, Wales, where her father was\nan internal revenue collector. In 1891 Isabel Maddison and her sister Annie were in\nBristol, England, with their brother, William T., a registered medical practitioner.\nAfter attending Miss Tallies School in Cardi\ufb00, in June 1885 Isabel Maddison\npassed the matriculation examination at the University of London (an examin-\ning body only and not a teaching institution at that time). She then entered the\nUniversity College of South Wales and Monmouthshire in Cardi\ufb00 and passed the\nUniversity of London intermediate science examination in 1887. She remained until\n1889 but did not earn a degree from University College, Cardi\ufb00, since it did not\ngrant degrees at that time.\n\nIn 1889 Maddison went to Girton College in Cambridge on a scholarship given\nby the Clothworkers\u2019 Guild. With another \ufb01rst-year student, Grace Chisholm, she\nobtained permission to sit in on Arthur Cayley\u2019s lectures at Cambridge. In the be-\nginning, her tutor at Girton was William Henry Young, who would marry Grace\nChisholm in 1896. Chisholm later wrote that for Maddison \u201ca high place in Tripos\nwas worth \u2018bread and butter and dresses and hats\u2019 \u201d (Grattan-Guinness 1972, 118).\nThus, Chisholm, who believed her own tutor, Arthur Berry, superior to Young, con-\nvinced Maddison to share her tutorial the following year. Maddison and Chisholm\ntook all their examinations at the same time; Maddison scored slightly better than\nChisholm the \ufb01rst two years. At the end of the third year when they sat for Part I\nof the Tripos in spring 1892, their placement was reversed; both earned \ufb01rst class\nwith Maddison equal to the twenty-seventh Wrangler. They both then uno\ufb03cially\nsat for the Oxford Final Honours School in mathematics, the \ufb01rst women to do so.\nChisholm remained another year at Girton and then went to G\u00a8ottingen to become,\nwith Mary Winston (Newson), one of the \ufb01rst three women to formally attend\nlectures and participate in the seminars there.\n\nIn 1892 Isabel Maddison came to Bryn Mawr College as a graduate student\nwhere she studied mathematics and practical physics. During that year she did\nwork in singular solutions of di\ufb00erential equations and in 1893 published a paper\nin the British Quarterly Journal of Pure and Applied Mathematics on families of\ncurves. Also in 1893, the University of London conferred a BSc with honours on her.\nAccording to the college archivist of Imperial College, London, she was \u201cjoint second\nhighest in maths for that year [and] tuition was from University College Cardi\ufb00,\nGirton (Cambridge), and Bryn Mawr. . . .\u201d During 1893\u201394, her second year at Bryn\nMawr, she was a fellow in mathematics, and in April 1894 was awarded Bryn Mawr\u2019s\n\ufb01rst Mary E. Garrett European fellowship. Charlotte A. Scott, in writing to Felix\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMADDISON - 2\n\nKlein asking that Maddison be admitted to the university at G\u00a8ottingen, referred to\nher as \u201cone of my best students.\u201d She also remarked, \u201cWhen she \ufb01rst came to Bryn\nMawr, she was, in my opinion, su\ufb00ering from the e\ufb00ects of overtraining during her\nseven years of undergraduate life . . . . But her mind soon recovered its elasticity, and\nmy opinion of her ability has increased steadily\u201d (Universit\u00a8atsarchiv G\u00a8ottingen).\n\nMaddison spent the year 1894\u201395 in G\u00a8ottingen studying with Klein and David\nHilbert, among others. The following year she was assistant secretary to M. Carey\nThomas, the president of Bryn Mawr. At the end of that year she was awarded her\nPhD with a dissertation written under the direction of Scott in the area she \ufb01rst\nstudied at Bryn Mawr, singular solutions of di\ufb00erential equations. For her doctorate\nshe was examined in the \ufb01elds of pure and applied mathematics and in physics.\nDuring the year 1895\u201396 Maddison prepared a translation of an 1895 address by\nFelix Klein to the Royal Academy of Sciences of G\u00a8ottingen, which appeared in the\nBulletin of the AMS.\n\nFrom 1896 to 1904 Maddison served as secretary to President Thomas and as\nreader in mathematics. In 1904 her administrative position changed to assistant\nto the president, while in 1906 her departmental position changed to associate\nin mathematics. She remained in her dual departmental, administrative positions\nuntil 1910 at which time she became recording dean and assistant to the president,\nremaining in these positions until she retired in 1926. For at least a short period of\ntime, Maddison lived with Charlotte Scott and Scott\u2019s cousin.\n\nAlthough Maddison remained at Bryn Mawr her entire career, the only time she\nwas an active participant in the Bryn Mawr Mathematics Journal Club that started\nin 1896 was during its \ufb01rst year when she spoke on \u201cCurves which cover an area\nof the plane.\u201d During her years as secretary to the president, Maddison compiled\ninformation for handbooks of universities open to women and for a statistical study\nof women college graduates. She also is listed as author on several Bryn Mawr\nalumnae registers. Soon after receiving her doctorate she published a number of\nbook reviews in the Bulletin of the AMS as well as a short note on the history of\nmap-coloring problems.\n\nAccording to the Bryn Mawr alumnae o\ufb03ce, \u201cin 1905 [Maddison] obtained leave\nto study at Trinity College, Dublin, where she received a B.A. degree\u201d (Williams\nPapers). The University of Dublin, as it was also called, does not have a record of\nher studying there. According to the university\u2019s information o\ufb03ce, Maddison \u201chad\nthe B.A. degree conferred on her by this University in 1905. She did not, however,\nstudy at the University but had completed the necessary exercises at the University\nof Cambridge to entitle her to have this degree conferred\u201d (Williams Papers).\n\nIsabel Maddison lived in Bryn Mawr most of the time she was associated with\nthe college. She made a trip to England nearly every summer. During World War\nI, she contributed to the war e\ufb00ort. One summer she did secretarial work for the\nWoman\u2019s Committee of National Defense; another summer she did statistical work\nfor the American Shipping Board. She and her older sister Janie sailed from Eng-\nland to New York in September 1925, before her retirement in 1926. At that time,\nshe indicated that she lived in Wayne, Pennsylvania, near Bryn Mawr. In the Oc-\ntober 1928 AMS membership list, she used an address of The Croft, Martin\u2019s Dam,\nWayne, which apparently was where she lived the rest of her life. She and her sister\nalso made a trip from England to New York in April 1929, and her sister was listed\nas living with her in the 1930 census.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nMADDISON - 3\n\nAlthough Maddison spent her last years in Pennsylvania, she maintained her\nidenti\ufb01cation with the country of her birth as a member of the London Mathe-\nmatical Society and of the Daughters of the British Empire. She died in her home\nin Wayne at age eighty-one in 1950. \u201cIn her will she bequeathed $10,000 to Bryn\nMawr in memory of M.

      "text": "WOOD, Ruth G. January 29, 1875\u2013May 5, 1939.\nSmith College (BL 1898), Yale University (PhD 1901).\n\nRuth Goulding Wood was the younger of two children of Kate Bassett (Pond) (1850\u2013\n1932) and Samuel Eugene Wood (ca. 1844\u20131891). Her mother\u2019s family was from Brooklyn,\nNew York, and her father\u2019s was from Central Falls, Rhode Island, where she was born.\nHer parents married in 1869; her father was a bookkeeper in the 1870s and manager of the\nyarn department of a manufacturing company in the late 1880s. Ruth\u2019s brother, Kenneth,\nwas born in 1873 and became a mechanical engineer.\n\nRuth Wood attended Pawtucket High School in Rhode Island before entering Smith\nCollege in Northampton, Massachusetts. She took the literary course at Smith, with major\nsubjects mathematics, German, and the sciences, and graduated in 1898. She entered Yale\nUniversity immediately after her graduation; she held a scholarship in 1899\u20131900 and a\nfellowship in 1900\u20131901. Although there is no formal indication of her advisor, most of her\ncourse work was taken with, and the department recommendation for her PhD in 1901\nwas signed by, James Pierpont, Percey F. Smith, J. Willard Gibbs, and William Beebe.\n\nWood was an instructor at Mount Holyoke College 1901\u201302 before joining the two-\nperson mathematics department at Smith College as instructor in 1902. Eleanor P. Cush-\ning, MA and Smith class of 1879, was professor and had joined the faculty in 1881; Harriet\nR. Cobb, MA, was instructor and had joined the faculty as assistant in mathematics in\n1895. Wood spent her career at Smith except for the year 1908\u201309, when she was studying\nat the university in G\u00a8ottingen. She was instructor 1902\u201309, associate professor 1909\u201314,\nprofessor 1914\u201335, and emeritus professor after 1935. She became chairman of the depart-\nment when Cushing retired in 1922 and remained so until 1928.\n\nExcerpts from the notebook of the mathematical club of Smith give some indication\nof the interests and activities of Wood. In 1903 she spoke on the laboratory method of\nteaching mathematics; in 1904 she explained beginning and spherical geometry; in 1907\nshe spoke on \u201cTransformations,\u201d and in 1909 she described her university experience\nat G\u00a8ottingen. In 1918 she discussed her work the previous summer at New York Life\nInsurance Company, and in fall 1928 she and Susan Rambo gave talks about their visit to\nthe International Congress in Bologna. Wood had also attended international congresses\nin Cambridge, England, in 1912 and in Toronto in 1924. She began attending meetings of\nthe AMS when she was still a graduate student and continued until the summer before\nher retirement.\n\nOther details emerge from Wood\u2019s notes in the Smith Alumnae Quarterly and from\nship passenger lists. Her interest in traveling is evident. She and her mother were in\nEurope in 1909; Wood traveled again to Europe in 1912. She spent the summer of 1913\nin Newfoundland and was in Europe the following summer. In her July 1929 entry in the\nQuarterly she anticipates a short trip to the Pyrenees in August. She was again in Europe\nin summer 1933. In February 1934 she began her \ufb01rst sabbatical semester since she joined\nthe Smith faculty in 1902 and traveled in Egypt, Greece, and Turkey with her sister-in-law\nand two nieces. In June 1935 she resigned from the Smith faculty at age sixty. In August\n1936 she reported that the previous winter she went to California via the Canal, visited\nYosemite, and did not miss teaching. In February 1937 she sailed on a cruise to South\nAmerica, went down the west coast, crossed the Andes by auto and mountain lakes by\nboat.\n\nIn 1931 Wood had moved to Florence, Massachusetts, a few miles from Northampton, to\na house she had designed. The house included a greenhouse to accommodate her expertise\nas a gardener. She also had a summer home in Cummington, in the Berkshire foothills.\nWood\u2019s mother, who had been living with her, died in May 1932.\n\nWood died of coronary thrombosis at sixty-four in 1939 in Spring\ufb01eld, Massachusetts.\nShe had no immediate survivors. In the minute read at Smith after her death it was\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWOOD - 2\n\nrecorded that she \u201cloved the beautiful in music and literature. She was an accomplished\nneedlewoman and an almost professional gardener. She had a genius for friendship and\nto all who knew her she was the embodiment of thoughtfulness, generosity and courage\u201d\n(Smith College Archives). Newspaper accounts indicate that upon the death of the last of\nthree bene\ufb01ciaries of a trust fund she had set up, the fund and accumulated interest were\nto go to the trustees of Smith College to assist in paying \u201cone or more women professors\nin the mathematics department a salary equal to the highest salary paid to any member\nof the teaching sta\ufb00 of the college\u201d (Spring\ufb01eld Union, 30 May 1939). In 1949 a gift of\n$5,000 was given to the college in memory of Wood. Her ashes were interred in Swan Point\nCemetery, Providence, Rhode Island.\n\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi.\n\nDissertation:\n1901 Non-Euclidean displacements and symmetry transformations.

      "text": "SCHULTE, Sister M. Leontius. September 4, 1901\u2013March 20, 2000.\nCollege of Saint Teresa (BA 1923), University of Michigan (MA 1931, PhD\n1935).\n\nSister Mary Leontius Schulte was born Catherine Mary Schulte in Cleveland,\nWisconsin, the youngest of seven surviving children of Mary (Wagner) (1862\u20131933)\nand Joseph Schulte (1860\u20131940), both natives of Wisconsin whose parents were born\nin Germany. Her parents had some grade school education and were married in 1885.\nSchulte remarked in a conversation with one of the authors in 1983 that her parents\nwere farmers, that her father was good-natured and faithful, and that she owed\neverything to them. Her older siblings were Ella (or Eleanor) (1886\u20131985), Lucy\n(1888\u20131990), Peter (1890\u20131976), Margaret (1892\u20131983), Josephine (1895\u20131982), and\nTheodore (1897\u20131987).\n\nCatherine Schulte attended primary school in Cleveland, Wisconsin, and grad-\nuated from high school in Manitowoc in 1919. That fall she entered the College of\nSaint Teresa in Winona, Minnesota, with the intention of studying home economics.\nHowever, she became interested in mathematics and received her bachelor\u2019s degree,\nwith a major in chemistry and minors in mathematics, French, and English, in\n1923.\n\nAfter her graduation Schulte taught mathematics at high schools in Minnesota;\nshe was at Holy Trinity High School in Rollingstone 1923\u201324, Saint John High\nSchool in Rochester 1924\u201326, and Saint John High School in Caledonia 1927\u201328.\nShe entered the Sisters of Saint Frances in Rochester on January 19, 1926 and made\nher profession of vows in 1927.\n\nSister Mary Leontius Schulte began her graduate work at the University of Michi-\ngan in the summer session of 1928 and became an instructor at the College of Saint\nTeresa that fall. Sister M. Thomas `a Kempis Kloyda, her slightly older colleague\nat the college, had a similar educational and professional history. She, too, had\nbeen an undergraduate at the College of Saint Teresa; she did graduate work at\nMichigan and then joined the faculty at the college in 1926. Both would earn their\ndoctorates at Michigan and spend the major part of their careers at the College of\nSaint Teresa.\n\nSister M. Leontius took graduate courses in mathematics and physics during\nthe four summers of 1928\u201331 and received her master\u2019s degree in September 1931.\nShe continued teaching except for the two academic years 1932\u201334, when she was\nin residence full time at the University of Michigan to \ufb01nish the course work for\nher PhD. During these two years she lived at Mercy Hospital in Ann Arbor. Her\ndissertation in the history of mathematics, like that of Sister M. Thomas `a Kempis,\nwas directed by Louis C. Karpinski. She was enrolled during the summer of 1934,\nwhen the dissertation was accepted, and the degree was conferred in March 1935.\nSister M. Leontius was instructor and associate professor at the College of Saint\nTeresa until 1948 when she was promoted to full professor. She retired as professor\nemeritus in 1975. During her years on the faculty she was particularly involved with\nissues concerning mathematics education and gave several talks to the elementary\nand junior high school sections of NCTM. She was a participant at NSF institutes\nand conferences at Ball State Teachers College 1959, Montclair State College 1961,\nOklahoma State University 1961, Washington State University 1962, and Teachers\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nSCHULTE - 2\n\nCollege, Columbia, 1969. In the summer of 1966 she attended a Cuisenaire workshop\nin Denver.\n\nSister Leontius did a television series of nineteen telecasts, Parents Ask About\nArithmetic, that were shown on KROC in Rochester in 1961\u201362, and \ufb01fteen ki-\nnescope recordings, Teaching Mathematics K\u20136, on KTCA in St. Paul the next\nyear. For the latter she prepared a Teachers Manual K\u20136, 1963. In the 1980s ma-\nterials from the programs were in the archives at the college. She credited Sister\nThomas `a Kempis with the pioneering idea of presenting mathematics on television.\nAmong the mathematics and educational organizations in which Sister Leon-\ntius participated were NCTM; the Minnesota Council of Teachers of Mathematics,\nwhere she served as a district board member 1970\u201375; South Eastern Minnesota\nTeachers of Mathematics; MAA, where she was on the executive committee of the\nMinnesota Section 1953\u201354 and 1955\u201356 and was chairman of the section 1954\u201355;\nand the Minnesota Education Association.\n\nIn college Sister Leontius liked athletics and played hockey, tennis, and basket-\nball. As a faculty member she was involved with the mathematics club and was a\nsponsor of the Legion of Mary, which ministered to the sick; she served as a pastoral\nminister and visited shut-ins. In the 1983 conversation she remarked that listening\nto music was one of her pleasures.\n\nSister Leontius received an alumnae citation from the College of Saint Teresa in\n1973. She remained there for several years after her retirement and did volunteer\nwork in the college o\ufb03ces. The College of Saint Teresa closed in 1987, and the\ncampus was purchased by a non-pro\ufb01t charitable foundation. Sister Leontius then\nlived at the Motherhouse, Assisi Heights, Rochester, Minnesota. She died in 2000\nat age ninety-eight in Rochester and was buried in Calvary Cemetery in Rochester.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: MAA, NCTM, Sigma Xi.\n\nDissertation:\n1934 Additions in arithmetic, 1483\u20131700, to the sources of Cajori\u2019s \u201cHistory of Mathe-\nmatical Notations\u201d and Tropfke\u2019s \u201cGeschichte der Elementar-Mathematik.\u201d PhD disser-\ntation, University of Michigan, directed by Louis Charles Karpinski.

January 22, 1902\u2013October 12, 1988.\nWilson College (BA 1925), Cornell University (MA 1931, PhD 1933).\n\nRoberta Frances Johnson was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the daugh-\nter of Mary Wallace (Abdill) (1874\u20131918) and Jesse B. Johnson (1875\u20131936). Her\nmother was born in New Jersey, her father in Philadelphia. Her parents were ed-\nucated through grade school and married in about 1895. Johnson later described\nher mother as a homemaker and her father as a mechanic; census records describe\nhis occupation as machinist. A sibling born before 1900 was not living in 1900. A\nyounger sister, Lillian, born about 1907, died at age three.\n\nRoberta Frances Johnson attended Frankford High School in Philadelphia before\nenrolling at Wilson College, a women\u2019s college in Chambersburg, Pennsylvania. At\nWilson she was a member of a literary club, the science club, and the international\nrelations club and was president of the latter her senior year. Upon graduation from\nWilson in 1925 with departmental honors in mathematics and a minor in history,\nshe remained in Chambersburg three years, 1925\u201328, to teach mathematics at the\nChambersburg high school. She taught mathematics and history for the next two\nyears in the high school in Newfoundland, Pennsylvania.\n\nJohnson attended summer sessions at Cornell University during 1929 and 1930.\nShe remained at Cornell in the fall of 1930 and enrolled with a fellowship from\nWilson College intending to major in mathematics and minor in modern European\nhistory. In February 1931 she received her master\u2019s degree with both her major\nand minor in mathematics. She retained the fellowship from Wilson during her\nthree years at Cornell and also held an Erastus Brooks fellowship her second year\nthere. After a third year of study at Cornell, with major subject geometry, \ufb01rst\nminor analysis, and second minor philosophy, she received her doctorate in 1933\nwith a dissertation in algebraic geometry directed by Virgil Snyder. Her published\ndissertation, 1934, was described by Snyder in a review of a French monograph\nas \u201can excellent introduction to this memoir\u201d (Bull. Amer. Math. Soc. 41 (1935):\n170).\n\nJohnson had expected to remain at Cornell 1933\u201334 as a \u201cresident doctor\u201d in\norder to continue her research. However, the head of the mathematics department\nat Wilson became ill, and Johnson was to substitute for at least a month beginning\nin September. When the head took a leave of absence, Johnson remained for the\nacademic year 1933\u201334 on a temporary appointment. Johnson taught at Wilson for\ntwenty-\ufb01ve years. She was an instructor 1934\u201335, assistant professor 1935\u201344, and\nassociate professor after 1944. During this time she taught all of the undergraduate\ncourses and honors courses. She was acting head of the department second semester\n1944\u201345 and became department head in 1946 when the previous chairman retired.\nAfter receiving her doctorate, Johnson stayed active in the mathematical com-\nmunity. She attended many local and national meetings of the American Mathe-\nmatical Society in the eastern United States, from Durham, North Carolina, north\nto Providence, Rhode Island. In 1951 she served as a referee for one of the AMS\npublications. During the summer of 1957, Johnson participated in a summer in-\nstitute in social sciences for college mathematics teachers at Stanford University.\nWhile at the institute she asked for a letter of recommendation from Robert J.\nWalker, a Cornell faculty member whom she had seen at meetings of the Amer-\nican Mathematical Society. She wrote, \u201cThis spring I decided, after 24 years at\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nJOHNSON - 2\n\nWilson College to make a change. This has not been an easy decision to reach\u2013it\nshould have been made twelve years ago when the former head retired. Unfortu-\nnately those of us who launched our careers in the midst of the depression have a\nfalse notion about security. Also, this will be my \ufb01rst experience in job hunting.\nPreviously the job or fellowship hunted me\u201d (Cornell University, Department of\nMathematics \ufb01les). She continued, \u201cI am prepared to adjust to a new pattern of\nwork and I expect to follow rather than lead in a new position. If necessary, I am\nready to leave the teaching \ufb01eld but I believe that I have the most to contribute\nin an academic position. However, I de\ufb01nitely desire to move to a co-educational\ninstitution. . . . I shall not bore you with the details of my reasons for this decision.\nMy fellow faculty members will view it as a refusal to accept the injustice of being\npassed over when promotions are made. It is not that alone. I need a change . . . \u201d\nIn a letter the following spring, she wrote that Wilson found out about her search,\nand she received a promotion to full professor and a tenure contract. However, she\ncontinued to look for a new position.\n\nIn 1958 Johnson moved to Fort Collins, Colorado, as an associate professor at\nColorado State University. While there she directed the theses of about eight mas-\nter\u2019s students. Johnson remained at Colorado State until her retirement as asso-\nciate professor emeritus in 1967. The following spring the University of Colorado\nannounced her appointment as an associate professor, and she taught at the Uni-\nversity of Colorado at Denver for three years after her retirement.\n\nJohnson indicated in 1985 that she was a Presbyterian until 1925 and had no\nreligious a\ufb03liation after that. In summer 1936 she was in Ann Arbor as a reader for\nthe College Entrance Board; in September of that year she traveled to Bermuda.\nDuring World War II, she did sewing for the Red Cross. She was also a member of\na Wilson College alumnae club. In the mid-1980s she listed reading as a hobby.\n\nRoberta Johnson died of bone cancer in 1988 at age eighty-six at her home in\nFort Collins. During her illness she was cared for by friends and by a local hospice\norganization, to which she bequeathed her house. Her remaining assets were given\nto the Fort Collins public library.

March 16, 1897\u2013February 13, 1986.\nCentral Holiness University (BA 1918), Penn College (BA 1921), University\nof Wisconsin (MA 1928), University of Chicago (PhD 1938).\n\nFannie Wilson Boyce was born near Lentner, in Shelby County, Missouri, and\nmoved to Colorado with her younger sister and her parents, Mary Virginia (King)\n(1867\u20131956) and George Wesley Boyce (1866\u20131942), when she was four. Her mother\nwas born in Missouri and her father in Delaware. Her parents had married on April\n18, 1895. Her father was a farmer in Missouri in 1900 and later a grocer. Her sister,\nLura (1898\u20131990), was also born in Missouri, earned a BA, taught mathematics,\nmarried, and was a county treasurer for sixteen years.\n\nThe family was living in Colorado Springs in 1900, and Fannie Boyce attended\ngrade school in Colorado 1903\u201310. Her family moved to University Park, Iowa,\nand she did her high school and \ufb01rst college work there. She indicated in her PhD\ndissertation vita that she was at the academy of John Fletcher College 1910\u201314 and\nreceived her BA from John Fletcher College in 1918. The college was called Central\nHoliness University at the time she was there; it adopted the name John Fletcher\nCollege in 1925. After her graduation from college in 1918, she taught in Iowa\nhigh schools two years; she taught mathematics in Leon 1918\u201319 and mathematics\nand Latin in Rolfe 1919\u201320. She then attended Penn College (now William Penn\nUniversity), a Quaker college in Oskaloosa, Iowa, where her sister had earned her\nBA in 1919. Boyce was at Penn College one year to earn a second bachelor\u2019s degree\nin 1921.\n\nBoyce taught at two schools during the next six years. In both she taught math-\nematics at the academy level and the \ufb01rst two years of Greek at the college level.\nIn 1921\u201322 she was at Olivet University (Olivet College after 1923, now Olivet\nNazarene University) in Illinois, and in 1922\u201327 she was at Marion College in Indi-\nana.\n\nBoyce studied at the University of Wisconsin during the academic year 1927\u201328\nand received a master\u2019s degree in 1928. After receiving her degree she applied for\na position at Wheaton College in Illinois \u201cbut was turned down, since the dean\nwas looking for \u2018a man with a PhD\u2019 \u201d (David D. Malone, Special Services, Buswell\nMemorial Library, Wheaton College to J. LaDuke, 29 Oct 1991). She taught in\nthe high school in Platteville, Wisconsin, 1928\u201329 and in the high school and junior\ncollege in LaSalle, Illinois, the following year before being hired by Wheaton College\nin 1930. Professor E. B. Skinnerof Wisconsin wrote in a letter of recommendation\nto the college president on January 29, 1930, that \u201cduring her residence here she\nwas regarded as one of the most careful and conscientious students that we had at\nthat period. She never took anybody\u2019s word for anything, and was never satis\ufb01ed\nuntil she had herself gone through every step of detail in the demonstration of every\ntheorem and every problem. She did excellent work . . . . She is a high class woman in\nevery way; a sincere and devoted member of one of the smaller Protestant churches,\nand is without a trace of frivolity or careless attitude toward her work and toward\nher associates\u201d (Wheaton College Archives).\n\nBoyce remained at Wheaton as assistant professor 1930\u201341, associate professor\n1941\u201346, and professor 1946\u201362. She pursued her graduate work at the University of\nChicago by taking leaves of absence in the academic years 1933\u201334 and 1936\u201337 and\nby taking courses every summer 1933\u201337 except 1936. She received her doctorate\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBOYCE - 2\n\nin August 1938. At some point during her tenure at Wheaton she was chosen to\nparticipate in a summer institute at Stanford sponsored by the National Science\nFoundation.\n\nBoyce\u2019s parents lived with her when she was in Illinois. It appears that they were\nliving in Chicago, at least in 1936\u201337 while she was completing her graduate work,\nand moved to Wheaton when she returned to resume her position at the college.\nHer father died in 1942. In March 1953 Boyce o\ufb00ered to resign since she was unable\nto carry her full load because of the time she needed to care for her mother, who\nwas injured nearly a year earlier. Her mother died about three years later.\n\nAfter her retirement from Wheaton College in 1962 as professor emeritus, Boyce\ntook a position as associate professor at Olivet Nazarene College, where she taught\nfrom 1963 to 1970. She was then at Owosso College in Michigan in 1970. She\nreturned to Wheaton, where she was a member of the Wheaton Bible Church and\ntutored students in her home until she was in her eighties.\n\nFannie Boyce was a resident of a heath care center in Lombard, Illinois, at the\ntime of her death from cardiac arrest at eighty-eight in 1986.

Her parents\nwere born in New Orleans and were married on January 11, 1898. Her father had\nan elementary school education, was a cigar classer in 1900, and later was a postal\nemployee; her mother received a high school and normal school education and be-\ncame an elementary school teacher. Adrienne Rayl was the eldest of eight children.\nHer siblings were Harold James (b. 1900), Ruth (1903\u20131987), Naomi (1904\u20131990),\nElsa (1907\u20131994), Leonora (ca. 1909\u20131921), Mabel (1910\u20131989), and Sophie (1913\u2013\n1994).\n\nAdrienne Rayl attended public grade school and Girls High School in New Or-\nleans, graduating from the latter in 1915 \ufb01rst in her class of \ufb01fty-one. She attended\nthe New Orleans Normal School from 1915 to 1917 and graduated, \ufb01rst in her class,\nwith a teaching diploma in 1917.\n\nDuring the next twenty-two years Rayl taught in the New Orleans public school\nsystem and completed all of her undergraduate and graduate work. In 1917 she\nbegan teaching seventh and eighth grades at the Beauregard School and began\nworking toward her bachelor\u2019s degree by taking courses for teachers and summer\nschool classes at Tulane University. She received her BA in education in 1924 and\ncontinued teaching at the elementary school until 1929, when she was transferred\nto the Edward Douglas White High School to teach mathematics. While teaching\nat the high school, where she remained until 1939, she attended summer school and\nafternoon classes, including classes by Nola Anderson (Haynes) and by Marie Weiss,\nat Tulane and earned her MA in 1934. She immediately began further graduate work\nat the University of Chicago in the summer of 1934. She took classes there for \ufb01ve\nconsecutive summers and the academic year 1936\u201337 and \ufb01nished her dissertation\nunder Walter Bartky in August 1939. Rayl\u2019s dissertation concerned the four-body\nproblem. She had begun work in this area while at Tulane and had solved a problem\nrelated to the three-body problem when taking a celestial mechanics course there\nfrom H. E. Buchanan.\n\nAdrienne S. Rayl spent the next three decades in Birmingham at the University\nof Alabama Extension Center (now the University of Alabama at Birmingham).\nWhen she arrived, there were no women students at the school.

The other children were Mary H. (b. 1885) and Horace Holmes (b. 1890). Her\nfather attended Rochester Theological Seminary and was ordained in 1879; he died\nin Fairport at forty-\ufb01ve, when Mildred Hunt was nine years old.

After her graduation in 1909, she taught in Wood-\nland College in Jonesboro, Arkansas, and at high schools in Brownsville, Ohio, and\nSistersville, West Virginia. She was an instructor of Latin and Greek at Hillsdale\nCollege in Hillsdale, Michigan, 1912\u201315. During the academic year 1915\u201316, Hunt\nstudied at the University of Chicago, where she had courses in Analytic Mechanics\nwith Kurt Laves, Di\ufb00erential Equations and De\ufb01nite Integrals with G.

She was professor of math-\nematics at Bessie Tift College (later Tift College, now closed), then a women\u2019s col-\nlege in Forsyth, Georgia, 1918\u201322. Tift College records indicate that she also taught\nat Denison at some point, perhaps in 1917\u201318. She resumed her graduate studies\nat Chicago, wrote her dissertation under Dickson, and received her PhD in 1924.\n\nHunt\u2019s thirty-year career at Illinois Wesleyan University, in Bloomington, Illinois,\nbegan in the fall of 1924. She joined the two-person department as assistant profes-\nsor and was promoted to professor two years later, when the department\u2019s previous\nprofessor left. She was the senior member of the department, which consisted of\ntwo people until a few years before her retirement.\n\nWhile at Illinois Wesleyan, Hunt served on various university committees and\nsometimes as freshman advisor.

She was a member of Kappa Alpha Theta social\nsorority.\n\nGibbens graduated in 1914, and from 1914 to 1917 she held a teaching fellowship\nin mathematics at Newcomb College while she was studying at Tulane University.\nShe received her master\u2019s degree in 1916, one of \ufb01ve master\u2019s degrees granted by\nTulane at that June commencement.\n\nIn 1917 Gibbens moved to Chicago, where she studied for nine quarters at the\nUniversity of Chicago during the next three years. In 1917\u201318 she was on the\nprogram committee of the Junior Mathematical Club, and in February 1918 she\nspoke at the club meeting about the lima\u00b8con, the topic of her master\u2019s thesis. In\n1918\u201320 she also held a fellowship in the mathematics department. Gibbens took\ncourses with E. H. Moore, L. E. Dickson, G. A. Bliss, E. J. Wilczynski, and F. R.\nMoulton, and wrote her dissertation under the direction of Wilczynski.\n\nAfter receiving her PhD from the University of Chicago in 1920, Gibbens took a\nposition as instructor at the University of Minnesota. She remained there through-\nout her career: as instructor 1920\u201325, assistant professor 1925\u201347, associate profes-\nsor 1947\u201358, and associate professor emeritus after her retirement in 1958. Her\nslightly younger colleague Elizabeth Carlson had a similar employment history\nthere. The two also shared an o\ufb03ce for many years.\n\nGibbens taught a variety of courses at Minnesota. They included elementary and\nadvanced undergraduate courses in algebra, geometry, and analysis, and several\ndealing with the mathematics of \ufb01nance. She was usually course chairman for at\nleast one course every quarter; this included administering the \ufb01nal examinations.\nShe was long associated with Raymond W. Brink, department chairman after 1940,\nin a course in the \ufb01eld of general education. She generally worked during a summer\nsession each year, often teaching di\ufb00erential equations or an upper level geometry\ncourse. In the summers of 1935 and 1936, she and Elizabeth Carlson co-taught a\nreading course for seniors. She also taught in the War Training Program in the\nsummers of 1943 and 1944 and served as acting chairman of the department for\nseveral weeks each summer from the mid-1940s until near the time of her retirement.\nWhile at the University of Minnesota, Gibbens regularly attended meetings of\nthe Minnesota Section of the MAA. At her \ufb01rst meeting in June 1921 she was\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nGIBBENS - 2\n\nelected to the executive committee of the section. The following year she served as\nacting secretary and was elected to the executive committee two more times during\nthe 1920s.\n\nGibbens returned to New Orleans after her retirement in 1958. In the late 1930s,\nshe indicated that her hobbies were gardening and music and that her favorite\nrecreations were golf and boating. In 1982 she wrote that she had worked as a\nvolunteer teacher in a hospital for crippled children. Gibbens died at age ninety\nat Tulane Medical Center in New Orleans after a long illness.

      "text": "LOGSDON, Mayme (Irwin) February 1, 1881\u2013July 4, 1967.\nUniversity of Chicago (BS 1912, MA 1914, PhD 1921).\n\nMayme Irwin was born in Elizabethtown, Kentucky, the daughter of Nan Belle\n(Farmer) (1857\u20131892) and James David Irwin (1852\u20131921), both of Kentucky. She\nwas the second of \ufb01ve children from her father\u2019s \ufb01rst marriage; her brothers were\nWilliam F. (1879\u20131944), Jessie C. (1884\u20131957), and Robert T. (b. 1888); her sister\nwas Mary (1892\u20131981). There were three children from her father\u2019s second marriage\nin about 1894: Madge L. (b. 1895), Myrtle I. (b. 1897), and James D. Jr. (b. ca.\n1906). Her father, a constable in Elizabethtown in 1880, became an attorney in\n1883.\n\nMayme Irwin attended public primary and secondary schools and graduated\nfrom the Hardin Collegiate Institute, all in Elizabethtown, Kentucky. The Institute\nwas primarily a preparatory school with a business course and a teachers\u2019 course, in\nwhich Irwin probably was enrolled. Although Logsdon wrote in her 1914 master\u2019s\nthesis vita that she had received a BA from Hardin, it is unlikely that the degree\nrepresented a four-year program.\n\nIrwin was a high school teacher and principal from 1900 to 1911. On August 1,\n1900, she married Augustus H. Logsdon (1859\u20131909), a businessman of nearby Mun-\nfordville. Logsdon had two children from his \ufb01rst marriage, Nell (b. ca. 1892) and\nOllie Preston (1897\u20131990); there were no children from his marriage with Mayme Ir-\nwin. In 1910, the year after she was widowed, Mayme Logsdon and her stepchildren,\nthen eighteen and twelve, were living with their aunt and uncle in Elizabethtown.\nHer stepson remained with an aunt in Elizabethtown, while her stepdaughter later\nmoved to the west, where she married and lived in Wyoming.\n\nLogsdon returned to school in 1911 at the University of Chicago, where she\ncompleted the work for her bachelor\u2019s degree in August of 1912. She began her\ngraduate study there in 1912 and after a year took a position as the mathematics\ninstructor and dean of women at Hastings College in Nebraska. After her \ufb01rst year\nthere, 1913\u201314, she returned to Chicago for the summer and completed the courses\nand thesis for a master\u2019s degree. She remained at Hastings College as professor\nof mathematics and dean of women for three more years, 1914\u201317. While there\nshe taught all of the mathematics courses, college algebra through di\ufb00erential and\nintegral calculus.\n\nLogsdon was an instructor at Northwestern University 1917\u201319 before resuming\nher graduate work at Chicago, as a fellow in 1919\u201320 and as an associate in 1920\u201321.\nAfter completing her doctorate at age forty in 1921, she remained at the Univer-\nsity of Chicago as instructor 1921\u201325, assistant professor 1925\u201330, and associate\nprofessor 1930\u201346; she retired as associate professor emeritus in 1946.\n\nMayme Logsdon was the only woman to hold a regular faculty position above the\nrank of instructor in the Chicago mathematics department before 1982. In addition\nto her faculty duties, she served as a dean in the College of Science 1923\u201327 and was\nhead of Kelly Hall, a graduate dormitory, for many years. Later she had a house\nbuilt in Ogden Dunes in nearby northwestern Indiana and commuted to Chicago.\nAlthough Logsdon was a student of L. E. Dickson, her interests shifted to al-\ngebraic geometry early in her career at Chicago. She sailed to Italy in June 1925\nto study in Rome on a foreign fellowship granted by the International Education\nBoard. Shortly before Logsdon returned from Italy in 1926, she gave a lecture in\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLOGSDON - 2\n\nRome based on her 1925 paper in the Transactions of the AMS. As noted in his au-\ntobiography, Apprentissage d\u2019un mathematicien, Andre Weil attended the lecture,\nand it was from the o\ufb00prints of this paper that he learned of Mordell\u2019s work on\nelliptic curves. In his autobiography, Weil referred to Logsdon as \u201cla jeune ameri-\ncaine\u201d although at the time of her lecture he was nineteen and she was forty-\ufb01ve.\nIn a private correspondence with one of the authors, Robert P. Langlands of the\nInstitute for Advanced Study wrote, \u201cI found Weil\u2019s treatment of her rather ungen-\nerous, as she in fact put him on the trail of something important in his career. . . .\n[S]he recognized the interest and importance of the theorem of Mordell, and . . .\nsimply having drawn Weil\u2019s attention to it earns her a small place in the history of\nmathematics.\u201d\n\nLogsdon resumed her duties at Chicago in October 1926. The following year she\nwas appointed the MAA representative to the American section of the Interna-\ntional Mathematical Union that was planning the 1928 International Mathematical\nCongress in Bologna. During the early 1930s she refereed papers submitted to the\nBulletin and the Transactions of the AMS and presided at scienti\ufb01c sessions at\nmeetings of that organization. At the University of Chicago, Logsdon regularly\ngave advanced courses in algebraic geometry and directed the PhD dissertations\nof four students in this area between 1933 and 1938. The students were Anna A.\nSta\ufb00ord (Henriques) 1933, James Edward Case 1936, Clyde Harvey Graves 1938,\nand Frank Ayres, Jr. 1938. During this period she was also interested in under-\ngraduate education, and, in addition to giving talks in that area, she wrote two\ntextbooks. The two-volume Elementary Mathematical Analysis, which appeared in\n1932 and 1933, is what might now be called an elementary functions or precalculus\ntextbook; the 1935 A Mathematician Explains treats topics prerequisite to calcu-\nlus and brie\ufb02y introduces both di\ufb00erential and integral calculus. In a 1937 article\nabout the mathematics curriculum in schools, her student Anna Sta\ufb00ord noted that\nA Mathematician Explains \u201cis not the kind of book you expect the public to get\nexcited about, but it is selling. When a news company orders twelve dozen copies\nyou know it is not for any altruistic notions about aiding the the cause of science.\nPeople want to read that book\u201d (p. 408).\n\nLogsdon was a member of the Central Association of Teachers of Mathematics\nand Science, a charter member of the MAA and an MAA governor-at-large 1940\u201342.\nShe also founded the Illinois section of Delta Kappa Gamma, an honorary society\nfor women in education, and was active in Sigma Delta Epsilon (now Sigma Delta\nEpsilon/Graduate Women in Science), for which she was president in 1939 and\nreceived applications for fellowships in the early 1950s. She held o\ufb03ces in Chicago\nchapters of AAUW, Phi Beta Kappa, and Sigma Xi.\n\nAfter her retirement in 1946 from the University of Chicago, Logsdon moved to\nFlorida, where she taught mathematics at the University of Miami until her second\nretirement at age eighty in 1961. After living in Miami for a while, she had a house\nbuilt in Coral Gables, where she lived until she moved to a nursing home. Logsdon\nwas a Baptist and a Democrat. She was an avid bridge player, who traveled around\nthe country to earn masterpoints. Her many international travels included trips to\nmost of Europe, the Yucatan, the Caribbean, and Greece. She was also interested\nin swimming, golf, and birds. She has been described by a relative and a family\nfriend as \u201ca magnet,\u201d \u201cpersonable,\u201d \u201cfun, funny, can do,\u201d \u201cvivid,\u201d and \u201cwarm.\u201d\nLanglands wrote of her, \u201cGiven her age at the time she \ufb01nished her thesis, her\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nLOGSDON - 3\n\nsubsequent development suggests a spirit and cast of mind that were intellectually\nopen and adventurous.\u201d At her death in 1967 at the age of eighty-six in Coral\nGables, Mayme Logsdon was survived by her sister, Mary E.

      "text": "WILSON, Hazel (Schoonmaker). October 31, 1888\u2013April 23, 1988.\nWellesley College (BA 1911), Radcliffe College (MA 1914), Cornell Univer-\nsity (PhD 1927).\n\nHazel Edith Schoonmaker was the daughter of Christiana M. (Abele), born in 1859\nin Pennsylvania, and Arthur Twing Schoonmaker, born in 1860 in Massachusetts. Her\nparents were married in about 1885; she was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the elder\nof two children. Her younger brother, Ernest (1894\u20131974), was also born in Philadelphia\nand later became a dentist. Her father graduated from the Hahnemann Medical College of\nPhiladelphia in 1894; shortly thereafter the family was living in West\ufb01eld, Massachusetts,\nwhere her father was described variously as a homeopathist, a physician, and a surgeon\nwith a specialty in diseases of women and children.\n\nHazel Schoonmaker graduated from high school in West\ufb01eld before she entered Welles-\nley College, from which she graduated in 1911 with a major in mathematics and a minor\nin German. She taught in high school in Massachusetts 1912\u201313 before entering Radcli\ufb00e\nCollege for graduate work. After receiving her master\u2019s degree from Radcli\ufb00e in 1914,\nSchoonmaker taught in high school in New York for a year and was acting associate pro-\nfessor at Denison University in Granville, Ohio, the following year, 1915\u201316. She taught\nin high schools in New York 1916\u201317 and in Pennsylvania 1917\u201319. During 1920 she was\nprofessor at McKendree College in Lebanon, Illinois; in 1920\u201321 she was acting professor\nat Augustana College, Rock Island, Illinois; and in 1921\u201322 she was professor at Gulf Park\nCollege for Women, a two-year school that had recently opened in Long Beach, Missis-\nsippi. The summer of 1922 she studied at Columbia University and then spent three years\nas professor at Western College for Women in Oxford, Ohio.\n\nSchoonmaker \ufb01rst attended Cornell University in the summer session of 1924; in her\napplication for admission of July that year she reported that she had done four and\na half years of college teaching. She began full-time study there in 1925 and remained\nat Cornell until 1928. She was appointed a scholar for 1926\u201327 and received her PhD\nin 1927 with a major geometry, \ufb01rst minor analysis, and second minor education. She\nremained at Cornell as resident doctor for a year after she received her doctorate, taking\ntwo mathematics courses and preparing typed notes for a course she had taken from Virgil\nSnyder on plane cubic curves. Those notes are now in the archives at Cornell.\n\nAfter leaving Cornell, Wilson was an assistant professor 1928\u201331 at the New Jersey\nCollege for Women, the public coordinate college for women associated with Rutgers Uni-\nversity in New Brunswick. While there she published three papers in algebraic geometry:\nher dissertation; a paper coauthored with H. C. Shaub, a fellow student of Snyder at Cor-\nnell; and a paper coauthored with Snyder that he mentioned in his 1934 article, \u201cSome\nrecent contributions to algebraic geometry,\u201d in the Bulletin of the AMS. She then joined\nthe faculty at Hartwick College in Oneonta, New York, replacing Roxana Vivian as the\nprofessor of mathematics. She remained for seven years, 1931\u201338, and left after her mar-\nriage in the summer of 1938.\n\nOn July 14, 1938, Hazel Schoonmaker married Levi Thomas Wilson (1885\u20131975), who\nhad a son and a daughter from a previous marriage. The marriage of these two mathe-\nmaticians was announced in the August 1938 Monthly. L. T. Wilson had graduated from\nWashington and Lee University, received a PhD in mathematics from Harvard Univer-\nsity in 1915, and in 1917 began his long career at the US Naval Academy in Annapolis,\nMaryland.\n\nFrom 1942 until 1951 Hazel Wilson taught and was chairman of the mathematics de-\npartment at Annapolis High School; she studied at Johns Hopkins during the summer of\n1945. In 1951 L. T. Wilson retired from the Naval Academy and became professor of math-\nematics and physics and head of the department of physics at Jacksonville State Teachers\nCollege (now Jacksonville State University) in Alabama. At the same time, Hazel Wilson\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nWILSON - 2\n\nretired from Annapolis High School and became associate professor of mathematics, also\nat Jacksonville State. In 1952 they both also became instructors at the University of Al-\nabama, Gadsden Center. In 1956 L. T. Wilson went to Doane College in Crete, Nebraska,\nagain as professor of mathematics and physics and head of the department. Hazel Wilson\nremained at Jacksonville and Gadsden Center for a year until 1957, when she joined her\nhusband at Doane as professor.\n\nThey both remained at Doane until 1959 when they moved to Jacksonville, Florida,\nshe as professor of mathematics and he as professor of physics and head of the department\nof physics and physical sciences at Jacksonville University. They both retired in 1964 as\nprofessors emeriti and later lived in Suncoast Manor, an Episcopal retirement community\nin St. Petersburg, Florida. Throughout many of her working years and for a few years\nafter her retirement, Hazel Schoonmaker Wilson was a frequent contributor of solutions\nto the Problems and Solutions section of the American Mathematical Monthly and to the\nProblems and Questions section of Mathematics Magazine. In the Monthly her solutions,\nor mentions of solutions, averaged about one a year from 1923 to 1968, while those in\nMathematics Magazine averaged two a year from 1954 to 1967.\n\nWilson was a member of the honor society Phi Kappa Phi and the education honor soci-\nety Pi Lambda Theta in addition to those listed below. She was treasurer of the Maryland\nCongress of Parents and Teachers 1939\u201345. She was an Episcopalian and was treasurer of\nthe Women\u2019s Auxiliary of Saint Luke\u2019s 1952\u201356, when they lived in Jacksonville, Alabama.\nShe was also treasurer 1953\u201356 of the Faculty Wives Club there. She was a member of the\nOrder of the Eastern Star and of the Florida Academy of Sciences.\n\nIn 1974, nearly \ufb01fty years after receiving her PhD, Hazel S. Wilson responded to a\nrequest for a donation to Cornell by honoring her advisor with a signi\ufb01cant contribution\nto the Virgil Snyder Book Endowment. The income from this endowment fund, \ufb01nanced\ncompletely by Wilson, allows the mathematics library to purchase several dozen books\nevery year.\n\nLevi Wilson died in 1975.

      "text": "AITCHISON, Beatrice. July 18, 1908\u2013September 22, 1997.\nGoucher College (BA 1928), Johns Hopkins University (MA 1931, PhD 1933),\nUniversity of Oregon (MA 1937).\n\nBeatrice Aitchison was born in Portland, Oregon, the daughter of Bertha Beat-\nrice (Williams) (1877\u20131935) and Clyde Bruce Aitchison (1875\u20131962). Her parents\nwere natives of Iowa and married in 1906. She had a younger brother, Clyde Bruce\nAitchison Jr. (1909\u20131969), who became a lawyer. Her mother was a musician and\nsinger; her father was a lawyer who had a distinguished career serving on state and\nfederal regulatory commissions and in private practice.\n\nClyde B. Aitchison, her father, earned a BSc from Hastings College in 1893, an\nMA from the University of Oregon in 1915, and a PhD in economics from Amer-\nican University in 1932. After completing his undergraduate work, he studied law\nin a private law \ufb01rm in Iowa and was admitted to the Iowa bar in 1896. He moved\nto Oregon in 1903 and served on various regulatory commissions there until 1916.\nThe family moved to Washington, D.C., when he became solicitor for the National\nAssociation of Railway Commissioners in 1916. In 1917 he became a member of\nthe Interstate Commerce Commission (ICC) and served as its chairman four times\nbefore his retirement in 1952. He then had a private law practice until his death.\nHe had an extensive record of writings, lectured at American University for a dozen\nyears, and received numerous awards, including honorary LLD degrees from Hast-\nings College and the University of Oregon. After his \ufb01rst wife\u2019s death, he married\nAda Chenoweth McCown (1886\u20131944), a political scientist who had earned a PhD\nfrom Columbia University in 1927 and was serving as a researcher in legislative\nreference at the Library of Congress just before their marriage in 1936.\n\nBeatrice Aitchison attended private school for four years in Portland before the\nfamily moved to Washington, D.C., where she attended public schools. She gradu-\nated with honors from Central High School in Washington shortly before her six-\nteenth birthday. She reported in 1981, \u201cI think that high school was very important\nto me . . . . I had two excellent instructors who were probably just out of college . . .\nand who were very excited about teaching\u201d (Smithsonian meeting tapes). She then\nattended Goucher College 1924\u201328. After graduating from Goucher in 1928, she\nworked for a year in New York City for the Metropolitan Life Insurance Company\nas its \ufb01rst female actuarial clerk. For eleven months in 1928\u201329 she took special\ncourses while working in New York, and she passed the \ufb01rst four parts of the ex-\naminations of the American Institute of Actuaries and of the Actuarial Society\nof America in April 1929. Aitchison reported later that at just barely twenty she\n\u201ccouldn\u2019t cope with New York City,\u201d so she resumed her study of mathematics in\nOctober 1929 at Johns Hopkins University (Smithsonian meeting tapes). From 1929\nuntil 1932 she was a University scholar at Johns Hopkins and earned a master\u2019s\ndegree in 1931 and a PhD in 1933.\n\nSince the Great Depression was in full force at the time of her doctorate, jobs were\ndi\ufb03cult to \ufb01nd. Aitchison recalled, \u201cI applied to 145 colleges and universities my\nlast spring at Hopkins . . . . Someone whom I didn\u2019t know but knew my background\nheld my application thinking she might have an opening at Westhampton College\n[the college for women] at the University of Richmond. Sure enough, [one of the\nfaculty members] got really sick and so on about three days notice I was down there\nteaching for one semester\u201d (Smithsonian meeting tapes). After that semester as\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nAITCHISON - 2\n\nacting associate professor, she served as lecturer in statistics at American University\nin Washington, D.C., 1934\u201335. She also wrote in her 1981 Smithsonian questionnaire\nthat American University \u201cinvited [her] to \u2018help\u2019 with statistics for \u2018experience\u2019 and\nno pay.\u201d She did, however, get credit for a graduate course in history of economic\nthought.\n\nAitchison\u2019s mother died in the spring of 1935, and she returned to Oregon where\nshe took a University of Oregon extension course in Portland in principles of eco-\nnomics. In 1936 she was a \ufb01eld supervisor for the Oregon Historical Records Survey\nof the WPA in Portland before spending the academic year 1936\u201337 at the Uni-\nversity of Oregon. In 1937 she received her second master\u2019s degree, this one with\nhonors in economics. When she returned to Washington in 1937, she again lectured\nin statistics at American University, continuing to do so through 1938\u201339; she also\nserved as a member of the faculty of the graduate school of the US Department of\nAgriculture. Starting in 1938 Aitchison held temporary assignments at the ICC and\nwhile in Washington she lived in her father\u2019s house near Dupont Circle. She was\none of thirty-\ufb01ve residents of the area interviewed in 1984 and 1985 for a master\u2019s\nthesis, \u201cSlices of the Pie: Black and White Dupont Circle from the 1920s to the\n1950s\u201d by Mara Cherkasky.\n\nAitchison returned to the University of Oregon as an economics instructor in\n1939. She continued her temporary assignments with the ICC during the summers\nand prepared a report for its Bureau of Statistics that was published in 1941. At the\nbeginning of 1942 Aitchison resigned her position in Oregon and began her long and\ndistinguished career as a transportation economist with the US government. Her\n\ufb01rst position was with the ICC, where from 1942 to 1948 she advanced from junior to\nsenior statistician, and from 1948 until 1951 she served as principal transportation\neconomist. During her service with the ICC, Aitchison continued to teach as a\nlecturer in statistics at American University 1942\u201344. From 1942 until 1945, she was\na consultant and head of tra\ufb03c analysis for the O\ufb03ce of Defense Transportation,\nand in 1950 she was assigned from the ICC as a consultant to the director of military\ntra\ufb03c of the Department of Defense. In 1946 Aitchison was a founding member of\nthe American Society of Tra\ufb03c and Transportation (now the American Society of\nTransportation and Logistics).\n\nAitchison left the ICC in 1951 and worked until 1953 as director of the Transport\nEconomics Division of the O\ufb03ce of Transportation at the US Department of Com-\nmerce. After this post was abolished in 1953, she worked for the US Post O\ufb03ce until\nshe retired in July 1971. Aitchison was director of transportation research 1953\u201358,\ndirector of transportation research and statistics 1958\u201367, and director of trans-\nportation rates and economics in her last position 1967\u201371. After her retirement\nshe was self-employed as a consultant in transportation issues.\n\nIn the period from the mid-1940s to the 1970s, Aitchison conducted studies on\ntransportation issues, testi\ufb01ed before numerous regulatory agencies, and gave many\ntalks on postal history and transportation at institutes and meetings of various\ntransportation groups and postmasters\u2019 conventions around the country. In addition\nto technical reports listed below, Aitchison wrote at least \ufb01ve others, two in the\nlate 1950s and three in the early 1970s, that do not appear to be available in any\nlibrary.\n\nDuring and after her government career, Aitchison received many honors. Gou-\ncher presented her with an Alumnae Achievement Citation in 1954 and awarded her\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nAITCHISON - 3\n\nan honorary DSc in 1979. In 1961 she was one of six career women in government\nchosen to receive the \ufb01rst annual Federal Woman\u2019s Award given by the Civil Service\nCommission. As a consequence of receiving this award, she was a member of the\nFederal Woman\u2019s Award Study Group on Careers for Women, a small group of\naward recipients who were asked by President Lyndon Johnson to make a study of\ncareers for women. The group\u2019s recommendations resulted in an amendment to the\nexecutive order banning discrimination in government employment to include sex\ndiscrimination.\n\nIn receiving the Federal Woman\u2019s Award she was cited for her leadership in\nresearch and training in transportation economics and tra\ufb03c management. It was\nnoted that as a result of her work, \u201cthe postal service was able to realize millions\nof dollars in savings.\u201d Her obituary in the Washington Post reports that \u201cin the\n1960s, she supervised a \ufb01ve-year study leading to renegotiation of contracts with\nair carriers, saving the government an estimated $50 billion a year.\u201d\n\nIn 1970 Aitchison was honored by the National Civil Service League with the\nCareer Service Award as one of the top ten government workers of the year, the only\nwoman in the group. She was named an Alumni Fellow of the College of Arts and\nSciences at the University of Oregon in 1996. The following year the Johns Hopkins\nAlumni Association honored her with a Woodrow Wilson Award for outstanding\ngovernment service noting that she was one of the highest ranking women in the\nfederal service at the time of her retirement.\n\nIn addition to consulting after her retirement, Aitchison spent signi\ufb01cant time\nin volunteer work with the elderly. She received a certi\ufb01cate with honors for a\nparalegal training program for seniors at George Washington University\u2019s Institute\nof Law and Aging where she studied in 1977\u201378. In the early 1980s she indicated\nthat she spent forty to \ufb01fty work days a year doing income taxes for the elderly\nwith the IRS Volunteer Income Tax Assistance (VITA) Program.\n\nAmong her interests were music, photography, sewing, and traveling. The Wash-\nington Post obituary states that she had studied the mamba and the samba at\nFred Astaire\u2019s dancing school and that \u201cshe also traveled widely, often by tramp\nsteamer, to such locations as the South Paci\ufb01c and Antarctica.\u201d\n\nBeatrice Aitchison described her political a\ufb03liation as mainly independent. She\nwas a member of the Daughters of the American Revolution, served on a hospital\nboard, and was active in the Goucher Club of Washington, serving as treasurer and\npresident. She also was a trustee of Goucher College 1969\u201372.\n\nShe was an active Episcopalian serving in a variety of positions. In 1963 she was\nthe \ufb01rst woman elected to the vestry of Epiphany Episcopal Church in Washington,\nD.C. She held many other positions in the church, including positions on the vestry\nof St. Margaret\u2019s Episcopal Church in Washington, D.C., in the 1980s. Altogether\nshe sang in church choirs from the time she was a young teen until about two years\nbefore her death.\n\nShe was very supportive of the schools where she had received her education.\nSummer grants for junior Goucher College faculty are available through the Beat-\nrice Aitchison \u201928 Non-Tenured Faculty Professional Advancement Fund. Aitchison\nwas also generous in her contributions to the Goucher library, allowing the librarian\nto select about eighty volumes from her personal library in 1963. In 1994 she es-\ntablished the Aitchison Public Service Fellowship, now called the Aitchison Public\nService Undergraduate Fellowship in Washington, at Johns Hopkins.\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nAITCHISON - 4\n\nCollections of her papers are deposited at the Schlesinger Library, Radcli\ufb00e Insti-\ntute, Harvard University, and at the University of Oregon. Those at the Schlesinger\nLibrary deal with the period 1943\u201356 and contain articles and speeches by her as\nwell as news releases concerning her appointment to the US Post O\ufb03ce. The more\nextensive collection at Oregon covers the period 1946\u201370 and includes records of\nthe Civil Aeronautics Board, the Interstate Commerce Commission, and the Post\nO\ufb03ce Department, as well as speeches and addresses.\n\nIn 1997 Beatrice Aitchison died of congestive heart failure at eighty-nine at Sibley\n\nMemorial Hospital in Washington, D.C.

April 25, 1902\u2013September 29, 2002.\nBrown University (Women\u2019s College) (PhB 1923, MS 1924), University of Wis-\nconsin (PhD 1930).\n\nElizabeth Thatcher Sta\ufb00ord, the eldest of three children, was born in Providence,\nRhode Island, to Evangeline K. (Flagg) (1877\u20131966) and Arthur Ervin Sta\ufb00ord (b.\n1875), a banker. Her mother was a direct descendent of Roger Williams, the founder\nof Rhode Island. Her parents, both natives of Rhode Island, married in 1899, and\nshe had two younger brothers, Stuart W. (b. 1904) and Harvey Chace (b. 1906).\nHarvey graduated from Brown University in 1927 and became an accountant in\nManhattan.\n\nSta\ufb00ord\u2019s family lived very close to Brown University. Because of \ufb01nancial di\ufb03-\nculties in 1918, she was only able to attend college by living at home. She attended\nWomen\u2019s College of Brown, graduated in 1923, and remained at the university an\nadditional year in order to earn her master\u2019s degree. In a 1995 interview for the\nOral History Program at the University of Wisconsin, she mentioned both R. G. D.\nRichardson and R. C. Archibald when asked if there were any faculty at Brown who\nhad in\ufb02uenced her. She noted that Archibald\u2019s in\ufb02uence extended beyond math-\nematics to his second interest, music, as he bought seats for students at Boston\nSymphony Orchestra concerts held in Providence. She also remarked that there\nwere two other women in her class at Brown and all three got teaching jobs in col-\nleges when they graduated; Ellen Clayton Stokes and Evelyn Wiggin (Casner) also\nreceived master\u2019s degrees from Brown in 1924. Elizabeth Sta\ufb00ord took a position as\na last-minute replacement for a faculty member at the University of Texas. Letters\nof recommendation from Richardson re\ufb02ect his high opinion of her. In one he noted\nthat she was well-trained, well-balanced and cultured and that she would be a great\nsuccess there. She spent the year 1924\u201325 as an instructor in pure mathematics (for\n$1800) at the University of Texas in Austin. In December 1924 Richardson notes\nin a letter to her that it is very ambitious if she takes a course for credit.\n\nSince no position was available for Sta\ufb00ord at the University of Texas the fol-\nlowing year, she applied for a job at Texas Technological College (now Texas Tech\nUniversity) in Lubbock, which was scheduled to o\ufb00er its \ufb01rst instruction at the\npostsecondary level in September 1925. She was hired as an adjunct professor and\nremained until 1928.\n\nDuring the summer of 1927, Sta\ufb00ord attended summer school at Brown and took\na graduate course from Mark H. Ingraham. Ingraham, who had received his PhD\nat Chicago in 1924 under E. H. Moore, left Brown for the University of Wisconsin\nin 1927 and urged Sta\ufb00ord to apply there for a fellowship so she could do graduate\nwork with him. She took a leave from her position at Texas Technological College,\nstudied at the University of Chicago in the summer of 1928, and entered the Univer-\nsity of Wisconsin with a fellowship in mathematics that fall. In October 1929, she\nand seven men were admitted to candidacy for the PhD. She held a fellowship again\nin 1929\u201330, and in 1930 she received her degree in linear algebra as Ingraham\u2019s \ufb01rst\ndoctoral student at Wisconsin.\n\nWhile Sta\ufb00ord was in Texas she had worked with H. S. Vandiver on computations\nto check Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem. In 1929, Vandiver, who had come to the University\nof Texas in 1925, published a paper in the Transactions of the AMS in which\nhe acknowledged Sta\ufb00ord\u2019s assistance with the computations. The following year,\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHIRSCHFELDER - 2\n\nwhile Sta\ufb00ord was at the University of Wisconsin, they coauthored a paper on\nthe subject that appeared in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences.\nVandiver continued to publish papers on Fermat\u2019s Last Theorem and continued to\nacknowledge Sta\ufb00ord\u2019s contributions.\n\nSta\ufb00ord reported later that while she was at Wisconsin she \u201chad fallen in love\nwith this man who worked in the mathematics department\u201d (Teicher interview\n1995). She returned to Lubbock for the year 1930\u201331 and then went back to Madi-\nson, where on June 6, 1931, she was married to Ivan S. Sokolniko\ufb00 (1901\u20131976) of\nRussia. Ivan Sokolniko\ufb00 immigrated to the United States in 1921, did his under-\ngraduate work at the University of Idaho, and received his PhD from Wisconsin\nin 1931. After a honeymoon trip to Manchuria to visit his parents that summer,\nboth returned to the mathematics department at Wisconsin. He progressed from\ninstructor to professor until he left in 1946 to \ufb01nish his career at the University of\nCalifornia at Los Angeles.\n\nElizabeth Sokolniko\ufb00 \ufb01rst served as instructor at Wisconsin 1931\u201332 and then\ncontinued in a number of irregular positions. Correspondence in the archives at Wis-\nconsin reveals circumstances of her initial appointment and of some appointments\nsubsequent to it. On September 15, 1931, Warren Weaver, then the department\nchair, wrote to Dean Sellery, the dean of the college, noting that the department\nwanted to recommend the temporary appointment of Mrs. Sokolniko\ufb00 since an in-\nstructor had left. He wrote, \u201cWe could not hope to get a person of Mrs. Sokolniko\ufb00\u2019s\ntraining and ability for the salary involved ($1800) except under very unusual cir-\ncumstances.\u201d In a letter of February 8, 1932, Mark Ingraham, the new chairman,\nwrote to the dean regarding proposed budget cuts: \u201cMrs. Sokolniko\ufb00 has taught\nfull time at a salary of $1800. Mrs. Sokolniko\ufb00 took her degree here a few years\nago and is both from mathematical ability and teaching ability a person of very\nsuperior quality\u2013one who could well rank as an assistant professor in any university.\nIf we make the cut contemplated above, it would seem almost necessary to drop\nher from the pay roll or retain her only for part time. I feel in general it is not\nwell to tie ourselves up with husbands and wives on the pay roll, but it is with\ngreat reluctance that I would make this change during the year when we have lost\nProfessor Weaver.\u201d On May 19, 1932, another letter from Ingraham to the dean\nfollowed regarding the Sokolniko\ufb00s.\n\nThere is no reason in justice why he [I. S. Sokolniko\ufb00] should not\nbe getting as much as the other assistant professors in the De-\npartment. Moreover, although Mrs. Sokolniko\ufb00 is one of our best\ninstructors and is better prepared than any other instructor to give\nadvanced work, we have omitted her from the tentative budget for\nnext year due to the fact that you do not feel it wise to retain the\nwife of a member of the Department on the sta\ufb00. Although you\nmay feel that this action is both necessary and wise, you can read-\nily understand how it would be discouraging to the Sokolniko\ufb00s in\nlight of the fact that they must know that there are a number of\nother couples engaged in teaching at the University of Wisconsin.\n(folder Budget 1931\u201333, box 1: 1924\u20131937, Budget Files, Depart-\nment of Mathematics, College of Letters and Science, University of\nWisconsin\u2013Madison Archives)\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHIRSCHFELDER - 3\n\nAfter a year as instructor and a year without a position, Elizabeth Sokolniko\ufb00 was\nhired primarily as a lecturer on an ad hoc basis for the next several years.\n\nDuring World War II, Elizabeth Sokolniko\ufb00, like Grace Hopper, wanted to join\nthe US Navy WAVES (Women Accepted for Volunteer Emergency Service) but was\ntold that she should teach mathematics instead. During the war, I. S. Sokolniko\ufb00\nspent much of his time in New York and Washington working with the National\nDefense Research Council. Elizabeth Sokolniko\ufb00 spent the war years in Madison\nteaching calculus and di\ufb00erential equations to army and navy groups, geologists,\nand engineers. In her 1995 interview, she said that \u201cwe were separated a lot during\nthose war years. . . . I was very much in favor of [Ivan\u2019s going to California] and very\nmuch in favor of my not going to California with him.\u201d Before their separation, the\nSokolniko\ufb00s had a fruitful mathematical relationship; in the period 1934 to 1941\nthey coauthored \ufb01ve signi\ufb01cant mathematical papers in analysis and the classic text\nHigher Mathematics for Engineers and Physicists. They were divorced in 1947, the\nyear after I. S. Sokolniko\ufb00 went to UCLA. In 1947 Elizabeth Sokolniko\ufb00 was given\na three-year appointment as assistant professor. In 1952 she was an invited speaker\nat a symposium on the mathematical training of engineers held at the summer\nmathematics meetings in East Lansing, Michigan. The symposium was described\nin an article in the Monthly the following year.\n\nOn March 7, 1953, Elizabeth S. Sokolniko\ufb00 married Joseph Oakland Hirschfelder\n(1911\u20131990), a professor of chemistry at Wisconsin. She took a leave of absence for\nthe year 1953\u201354. Joseph Hirschfelder was a native of Baltimore who had done his\nundergraduate work at Yale and received a PhD from Princeton in physics and\nchemistry in 1936. He joined the chemistry department at Wisconsin in 1937 and\nremained until his retirement in 1981 except for military research during World War\nII. Between 1942 and 1946, he was with the National Defense Research Committee\n(NRDC) in Washington, D.C., was a group leader at Los Alamos working on the\ndevelopment of the atomic bomb, and was at a naval ordinance test station in\nCalifornia. Some years after his return to Madison, he was the founder of UW-\nMadison\u2019s Theoretical Chemistry Institute. He was elected to the National Academy\nof Sciences in 1953 and was awarded the National Medal of Science in 1976. After\ntheir marriage, Elizabeth Hirschfelder spent the summer proofreading a lengthy,\nand later, classic text that her husband coauthored. Joseph O. Hirschfelder also\nacknowledged the help of his wife in papers he published in the mid-1950s. He\nretired from Wisconsin in 1981.\n\nIn 1954 Elizabeth \u201cBetty\u201d Hirschfelder resigned her position as assistant pro-\nfessor of mathematics in order to be able to accompany Joseph \u201cJoe\u201d Hirschfelder\nwhen he traveled to give lectures. In 1957 they took a trip around the world. In\nthe mid-1970s they began to split their time between Madison, Wisconsin, and\nSanta Barbara, California, where Joe Hirschfelder was an adjunct professor at the\nuniversity. Joseph Hirschfelder died of cancer in their home in Madison in 1990. In\nthe early 1990s, Betty Hirschfelder helped endow a fellowship at the University of\nCalifornia at Santa Barbara; the UCSB Faculty Women\u2019s Club makes awards of\nthe Broida-Hirschfelder Graduate Fellowship in the Sciences to doctoral students\nin all \ufb01elds of engineering, science, and mathematics. She provided funding for the\nJoseph O. Hirschfelder Prize in Theoretical Chemistry established at the University\nof Wisconsin in 1992 in honor of her late husband and was a leading donor for an\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHIRSCHFELDER - 4\n\naddition to the chemistry building there for which ground was broken in September\n1999.\n\nElizabeth S. Hirschfelder spent her winters in Santa Barbara and died at age one\nhundred in September 2002 in Madison, Wisconsin. She left signi\ufb01cant bequests to\nthe Broida-Hirschfelder Endowment and to the University of Wisconsin that allowed\nfor the establishment of the Elizabeth Hirschfelder Fund for Graduate Women in\nMathematics, Chemistry and Physics.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma Xi.\n\nDissertation:\n1930 [Sta\ufb00ord, E.

April 11, 1914\u2013February 5, 1988.\nUniversity of Wisconsin (BA 1934, MA 1934), Brown University (PhD 1939).\n\nDorothy Lewis Bernstein was born in Chicago, Illinois, the eldest of four surviving\ndaughters and one son of Tillie (Loyev, later Lewis) (1887\u20131969) and Jacob Louis\nBernstein (1880\u20131956). Both parents were born in Russia and immigrated early in\nthe century. Her father came to New York in 1902 and her mother to Milwaukee in\n1907, at which time her mother\u2019s family assumed the name Lewis. Her parents were\nmarried in Milwaukee in 1912 and were naturalized in 1915. The \ufb01rst three children,\nDorothy, Naomi (1915\u20131996), and Myrtle (1917\u20131992), were born in Chicago where\nher father had started a dairy business in 1911. In 1918 the family moved to a\nfarm in Jackson, Wisconsin, about thirty miles northwest of Milwaukee. The next\ntwo children, Elinor (1919\u20131920) and Clarice (b. 1922), were born in Jackson. In\n1924 the family moved again, this time to Milwaukee where, in 1925, her father\nstarted another dairy, and where their last child, Sheldon, was born in 1927. All\nof the surviving children earned advanced degrees, Myrtle (LeBow) an MD and all\nthe others PhD\u2019s: Sheldon in 1952 (University of Wisconsin, biochemistry), Naomi\n(Golan) in 1969 (University of Chicago, social work), and Clarice (Ya\ufb00a Draznin) in\n1985 (University of Southern California, history). In 1972 Ya\ufb00a Draznin published\nIt Began with Zade Usher: The History and Record of the Families Bernstein\u2013\nLoyev/Lewis\u2013Mazur , for which Dorothy Bernstein wrote the foreword.\n\nBernstein attended public primary and secondary schools in Milwaukee and grad-\nuated from high school as valedictorian in 1930 at age sixteen. She then entered\nthe University of Wisconsin, where she majored in mathematics. By October 1932,\nwhen she was just over eighteen, the department voted that she be permitted to\nfollow a program of advanced independent study. During the next two years she\nworked with Mark H. Ingraham, Rudolf Langer, and Theodore Bennett and received\nher bachelor\u2019s and master\u2019s degrees in 1934 on the basis of a single examination and\na thesis on \ufb01nding the complex roots of polynomials by an extension of Newton\u2019s\nmethod. Her last year as an undergraduate she was a University scholar. She was\n\ufb01rst in a class of two thousand, and her bachelor\u2019s degree was awarded summa cum\nlaude. After receiving her degrees, she remained at Wisconsin as a University fellow\nfor the year 1934\u201335, doing further graduate work and teaching.\n\nBernstein continued her graduate studies at Brown University, where for two\nyears, 1935\u201337, she held a scholarship and taught at Pembroke College, Brown\u2019s\ncoordinate women\u2019s college. She completed her dissertation on the Laplace double\nintegral and received her PhD from Brown in 1939. She was also an instructor at\nMount Holyoke College from 1937 to 1940.\n\nBernstein reported a Milwaukee, Wisconsin, mailing address for the September\n1940 AMS membership list. In 1941 she returned to the University of Wiscon-\nsin for a year as an instructor. In June 1942 she became a research associate to\nthe statistician Jerzy Neyman working on theoretical problems in probability at\nthe Statistical Laboratory of the University of California, Berkeley, where she also\ntaught a graduate course in probability theory in the mathematics department. In\nher 1978 contribution to an AWM panel, published in 1979, she notes that she left\nafter only eight months because \u201cNeyman and I did not see eye-to-eye on what was\nthe mathematical justi\ufb01cation of a statistical procedure\u201d (p. 10). Erich L. Lehmann,\na graduate student at Berkeley at the time, later quoted Neyman as saying that\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBERNSTEIN - 2\n\n\u201cDorothy Bernstein . . . has just come to me and said she doesn\u2019t like the kind of\nstu\ufb00 that we do because it\u2019s not really nice mathematics. She wants to leave\u201d (De-\nGroot 1986, 244). Bernstein was unemployed for several months, but in fall 1943 she\nmoved to the University of Rochester as an instructor. In 1946 she was promoted\nto assistant professor, in 1951 to associate professor, and in 1957 to professor. She\nspent three years as acting chairman of the department. She also directed three\nPhD dissertations, including that of her later collaborator and close friend, Geral-\ndine Coon, in 1950. Her other two doctoral students were John M. Perry, 1960, and\nDavid M. Burton, 1961.\n\nWhile at Rochester she was asked by C. B. Tompkins, who was working at\nEngineering Research Associates on a contract from the O\ufb03ce of Naval Research,\nto undertake a study of the current state of knowledge of existence theorems in\npartial di\ufb00erential equations. As she explained in her 1978 AWM talk, \u201csome of the\nproofs could be used as basis for the computational solutions of non-linear problems\nthat were just being tackled by high-speed digital computers.\u201d Her 1950 book with\nPrinceton University Press was the result of this undertaking. She spent the year\n1950\u201351 as a member of the Institute for Advanced Study and the year 1957\u201358\nas a visiting professor at the Institute for Numerical Analysis of the University of\nCalifornia, Los Angeles. During the 1950s she wrote more than \ufb01fty reviews for\nMathematical Reviews.\n\nIn 1959 Bernstein went to Goucher College as professor and remained there\nuntil she retired in 1979 as professor emeritus. She was chairman of the department\nfrom 1960 until 1970 and director of the computer center from 1962 until 1967.\nShe spent the year 1966\u201367 as visiting professor of applied mathematics at Brown.\nShe returned to Brown in the fall of 1973 and spent the spring of 1974 at the\nUniversity of Tennessee. While at Goucher, Bernstein became very active in the\nuses of the computer in education and in the spring of 1971 was part of a group\nthat founded the Maryland Association for the Educational Uses of Computers.\nShe was instrumental in obtaining funds for computers at Goucher and helped run\nan NSF summer institute in computer-based mathematics for high school teachers.\nAt her retirement Goucher presented her with an award for distinguished service\nto the college. In 1981 Towson State University awarded her an honorary Doctor\nof Humane Letters (LHD). She was a fellow of the AAAS.\n\nIn 1985 Bernstein received a Certi\ufb01cate for Meritorious Service from the Mary-\nland-District of Columbia-Virginia Section of the MAA, having served the section\nas governor 1965\u201368 and the national MAA in many capacities. She served on\nand chaired various committees and was a member of the editorial board of the\nTwo-Year College Mathematics Journal. At the national level she was \ufb01rst vice\npresident 1972\u201373 and president 1978\u201380, the \ufb01rst woman in this role in the MAA\u2019s\nhistory. From the early 1970s through the early 1980s Bernstein was often an invited\nspeaker at sectional meetings of the MAA. In addition to her work with the MAA,\nshe served on advisory panels of other national associations and for the National\nScience Foundation.\n\nAt the time of her retirement from Goucher College in 1979, a pair of articles ap-\npeared in the Goucher Quarterly, \u201cBernstein on Coon\u201d and \u201cCoon on Bernstein.\u201d\nGeraldine Coon, Bernstein\u2019s 1950 doctoral student, came to Goucher in 1964 and\nretired the same year as Bernstein. After giving a detailed description of Bernstein\u2019s\nmathematical activities and work at Goucher, Coon added that in addition to her\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nBERNSTEIN - 3\n\nduties as president of the MAA, \u201cwhenever possible, she indulges in her favorite\nhobbies of gardening, canning, and freezing. She intends to maintain the famous\nBernstein Box at the Preakness, where annually the laws of probability and statis-\ntics fall into complete disarray\u201d (17). Coon remained at Goucher an additional year\nbefore she returned to her home on the Pawcatuck River in Connecticut. Bernstein\nand Coon shared the home until Bernstein\u2019s death.\n\nFor several years after her retirement Dorothy L. Bernstein maintained an a\ufb03lia-\ntion with Brown University, which was about forty-\ufb01ve miles from her Connecticut\nhome. She died at the Rhode Island Hospital in Providence in February 1988 at\nthe age of seventy-three. She was survived by her three sisters, Dr. Naomi Golan\nand Dr. Myrtle LeBow, both of Israel, and Dr. Ya\ufb00a Draznin of Los Angeles; and\nby her brother, Dr. Sheldon Bernstein of Milwaukee. She was buried in Milwaukee.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, SIAM, AAAS, AAUP, Phi Beta Kappa, Sigma\nXi.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1934 Some problems in the approximation of the roots of polynomials.

      "text": "ROSENBAUM, Louise (Johnson). January 21, 1908\u2013January 16, 1980.\nUniversity of Colorado (BA 1928, MA 1933, PhD 1939).\n\nLaura Louise Johnson was born in Carrollton, Illinois, the youngest of \ufb01ve chil-\ndren of Ida Jane (Taylor) (1868\u2013ca. 1940) and William Foster Johnson (1868\u2013ca.\n1939) of Illiniois. Her parents married in Illinois in June 1892, and all of their chil-\ndren were born there. They were Minnie E. (1893\u20131980), Mildred M. (1894\u20131983),\nViola C. (1897\u20131970), Ebert Taylor (1899\u20131949), and Laura Louise, who was known\nas Louise. The family moved from Illinois to a farm outside of Boulder, Colorado,\nin about 1918, when Louise Johnson was ten. She attended country school through\ngrade nine and at age thirteen moved by herself into Boulder in order to attend a\nschool that o\ufb00ered a stronger preparatory program.\n\nAfter completing high school at sixteen, Johnson entered the University of Col-\norado, where she did all of her undergraduate and graduate work. Burton W. Jones\nand Robert A. Rosenbaum recalled that her \ufb01nancial resources for her undergrad-\nuate work consisted of \ufb01fty dollars from her parents and her salary from a job as a\nchecker in the university cafeteria during all her years as an undergraduate. They\nalso reported that \u201cshe might have majored in geology if she could have a\ufb00orded\nthe laboratory and \ufb01eld trip fees\u201d (Jones and Rosenbaum, 17).\n\nLouise Johnson taught in high schools in eastern Colorado for two years after\nreceiving her bachelor\u2019s degree in 1928. In May 1930 she was enumerated as a\nhigh school teacher in Armel in Yuma County. That autumn she returned to the\nUniversity of Colorado and began her graduate studies working as an assistant in\nmathematics for at least two years and as an instructor in the extension division\nof the university most of the rest of the time she was there. \u201cFor administrative\nreasons, she was always described as a \u2018part-timer\u2019, even during those (rare) quarters\nwhen she taught 17 or 18 hours per week, the full-time load being 16 hours. With\nscrupulous attention, [Aubrey] Kempner saw to it that she received more than a\nfull-time salary on such occasions\u201d (Jones and Rosenbaum, 17). One year in the\nearly 1930s she also taught mathematics at a Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC)\ncamp, a considerable distance from Boulder. Johnson received her master\u2019s degree in\n1933 after completing a thesis directed by Kempner, who also directed her doctoral\ndissertation in number theory. Paul Erd\u00a8os wrote the review of the article based on\nher dissertation for the Mathematical Reviews and \u201cbecame a good friend because\nof his interest in [her] results\u201d (Rosenbaum correspondence 1998).\n\nJohnson received one of two PhD\u2019s awarded in mathematics by Colorado in 1939.\nThe other went to Marjorie Beaty. They were the fourth and \ufb01fth doctorates given\nin mathematics at Colorado since the \ufb01rst in 1906; the sixth was not awarded until\n1951.\n\nAfter Johnson \ufb01nished her work for the PhD, \u201cshe was told by Kempner that\nthere was really no future for her in Boulder since two of the four professorial\nmembers of the department were women\u201d (Jones and Rosenbaum, 18). One of the\nwomen was Claribel Kendall, an associate professor and native of Colorado who\nhad received a PhD from the University of Chicago in 1921. The other was Frances\nStribic, an assistant professor who had completed all her work for a PhD except for\nher dissertation.\n\nIn the fall of 1939 Johnson was one of four fellows who had gone to Reed College\nin Portland, Oregon, to participate in a mathematics teaching seminar sponsored by\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nROSENBAUM - 2\n\nthe General Education Board and run by Reed\u2019s Professor F. L. Gri\ufb03n. One of the\nother teaching fellows that year was Robert A. Rosenbaum. Rosenbaum, who was\nborn in 1915 in New Haven, Connecticut, shortly after his father, Joseph Rosen-\nbaum, had earned a PhD in mathematics from Cornell, had earned his bachelor\u2019s\ndegree from Yale in 1936. He had spent the year 1936\u201337 as a fellow of the Henry\nFund in Cambridge. After the 1939\u201340 academic year both Johnson and Rosen-\nbaum stayed on at Reed as instructors. They were married on August 1, 1942. R.\nA. Rosenbaum spent the next three years in the navy, while Louise Rosenbaum\nremained at Reed College, as instructor until 1943 and then as assistant professor\nafter 1943. While he was a naval aviator in the Paci\ufb01c, she \u201ccontinued to teach at\nReed, carrying a particularly heavy load in a military pre-meteorology program\u201d\n(Jones and Rosenbaum, 18). She apparently did not spend the entire war years in\nOregon, since she reported an address in Hollywood, Florida, in the 1944 MAA\nmembership list. In F. L. Gri\ufb03n\u2019s 1969 reminiscences he noted that when \u201cthe war\nwas over . . . Reed got our Bob and Louise Rosenbaum back, a great day for Reed\u201d\n(466).\n\nRobert Rosenbaum returned to Reed as assistant professor in 1945\u201346. He \ufb01n-\nished his PhD from Yale in 1947, returned to Reed as associate professor in the\nfall of 1947, and was promoted to professor in 1949. In 1950\u201351 he was a visiting\nprofessor at Swarthmore College. Louise and Robert Rosenbaum remained on the\nfaculty at Reed until 1953, when Robert Rosenbaum joined the faculty at Wes-\nleyan University in Middletown, Connecticut, as professor of mathematics. He later\nbecame dean of science, provost, academic vice president and provost, and acting\npresident. In 1985 he was named University Professor of Mathematics and the Sci-\nences, emeritus. During 1958\u201359 he was an NSF fellow at the Mathematics Institute\nat Oxford.\n\nThe Rosenbaums had three sons: Robert Johnson, Joseph Gri\ufb03n, and David\nWilliam, born in 1943, 1946, and 1948, respectively. Jones and Rosenbaum report\nthat while the Rosenbaums were at Reed \u201cdespite the duties of a growing family . . .\nthere was no semester during which Louise did not teach at least one course\u201d (18).\nThey add that she also directed \u201cnotable undergraduate theses\u201d and served on ma-\njor college committees. After the Rosenbaums moved to Connecticut permanently\nin 1953, Louise Rosenbaum\u2019s regular teaching stopped. She had occasional visiting\nappointments at Trinity College in Hartford, Connecticut College in New London,\nand was a visiting faculty member at Smith College in 1973\u201374 when Robert Rosen-\nbaum was a visiting professor at the nearby University of Massachusetts. She also\nwas a professor at Saint Joseph College in West Hartford. She stayed active in\nmathematics education, serving on a committee of the School Mathematics Study\nGroup (SMSG) and directing summer institutes for teachers in Connecticut and\nOregon. During the 1950s and 1960s, she and her husband published, and revised\nseveral times, a pamphlet listing books appropriate for high school libraries. She\nalso wrote a short book on mathematical induction.\n\nChief among Louise Rosenbaum\u2019s interests was hiking. While at Colorado she\nhelped to arrange and guide tours of students into the mountains by bus or back-\npacking and climbed many of the high peaks of Colorado. She was also an expert\nskier, who skied in Colorado, Oregon, and Europe. Her husband reported that she\nbecame a member of the Society of Friends, \u201c\ufb01nding its philosophy, values, and\nsocial concerns particularly appealing\u201d (Rosenbaum correspondence 1998).\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nROSENBAUM - 3\n\nLouise Rosenbaum died in Middletown, Connecticut, in 1980 shortly before her\nseventy-second birthday after having su\ufb00ered from a progressive circulatory disorder\nfor nearly a decade.\nOrganizational a\ufb03liations: AMS, MAA, AAUP, Phi Beta Kappa.\n\nThesis and dissertation:\n1933 [Johnson, L.

August 27, 1907\u2013August 27, 2002.\nDelta State Teachers College (BS 1928), University of Missouri (MA 1929,\nPhD 1932).\n\nMarguerite Lenore Zeigel was born in Kirksville, Missouri, the second of four\nchildren of Elizabeth (Neef) (1879\u20131975) and William Henry Zeigel (1875\u20131947),\nnatives of Missouri who married in 1900. Her father received a bachelor\u2019s degree in\n1900 from Missouri Valley College and a master\u2019s degree in 1904 from the University\nof Missouri. From 1917 to 1925 he was a teacher, dean, and head of the mathematics\ndepartment at the State Teachers College in Kirksville, Missouri. In 1924 her father\nearned a PhD from George Peabody College for Teachers; the following year he\nbecame dean and head of the Department of Education at Delta State Teachers\nCollege (now Delta State University) in Cleveland, Mississippi, where he remained\nuntil 1946. Marguerite Zeigel\u2019s siblings were William (1904\u20132006), Elizabeth (1910\u2013\n2003), and Howard (b. ca. 1920). Her sister, Elizabeth Zeigel Winter, was a professor\nand supervisor of student teachers at Delta State Teachers College.\n\nMarguerite Zeigel received her elementary and secondary education in Kirksville,\nMissouri. She then attended Delta State Teachers College from 1925 until she re-\nceived her bachelor\u2019s degree in education in 1928, the \ufb01rst year bachelor\u2019s degrees\nwere awarded there. At Delta State she was a member of the college debating team\nand at graduation was ranked \ufb01rst in her class. The next three years she was a stu-\ndent at the University of Missouri. She was a Gregory scholar 1928\u201329 and received\nher master\u2019s degree in 1929. She was a Gregory fellow 1929\u201331.\n\nZeigel returned to Delta State as an assistant professor of mathematics and\nphysics for the year 1931\u201332. She received her PhD from Missouri in 1932 after\ncompleting her dissertation in geometry with a minor in physics. She then took\na position as assistant professor at a women\u2019s college, Lander College (now the\ncoeducational Lander University), in Greenwood, South Carolina. The following\nyear she was promoted to professor.\n\nOn August 7, 1936, at the end of her fourth year at Lander, Zeigel married\nErnest Albert Hedberg (1903\u20131961). Ernest A. Hedberg was born in Huntington,\nMissouri, to Swedish parents. His father was a farmer and his mother a housewife.\nHe received his BS from Northeast Missouri State Teachers College in 1928 and\nstudied at Stanford University in 1928. He was a graduate student in mathematics\nat the University of Missouri during 1929\u201330, Marguerite Zeigel\u2019s second year there.\nHe was an instructor at Wentworth Military Academy 1930\u201332 and received his PhD\nfrom Missouri in 1935. He was a professor at Alabama State Teachers College in\nLivingston 1935\u201336.\n\nThe year following their marriage, 1936\u201337, Ernest Hedberg was professor at\nLander, and Marguerite Z. Hedberg was not on the faculty. The following year he\nwas professor and acting head of the department at the University of South Dakota.\nIn 1938 Ernest and Marguerite Hedberg were both hired at Baylor University in\nWaco, Texas. On her 1982 Smithsonian questionnaire Marguerite Hedberg described\nherself as a teacher in 1938\u201340 and Ernest Hedberg as an associate professor 1938\u2013\n42.\n\nDuring 1942\u201343 Marguerite Hedberg returned again to Delta State, this time\nas professor and acting head of the department. That year Ernest Hedberg was\nan instructor of mathematics, physics, and meteorology at the US Navy Pre\ufb02ight\n\n\fBook Web Page\n\nHEDBERG - 2\n\nSchool on the campus of the University of Georgia in Athens. During 1943\u201344\nMarguerite Hedberg was an assistant professor at the University of Georgia while\nher husband was teaching in a US Army Specialized Training Program. In 1944 she\nworked as a civilian for the US O\ufb03ce of Scienti\ufb01c Research and Development while\nhe was a technical writer in California for a National Defense Research Committee\n(NDRC) Project. Ernest Hedberg then served as an associate professor of electrical\ncommunications in the radar school at MIT 1944\u201346.\n\nIn 1946, after the war, they both were hired by the University of South Carolina\nin Columbia. Marguerite Hedberg was an adjunct professor 1946\u201349 and in 1949\nbecame an associate professor; she retired as associate professor emeritus in 1976.\nErnest Hedberg became a professor in 1950; he died in 1961.\n\nMarguerite Hedberg was a member of the education honorary society, Pi Lambda\nTheta. She was a Presbyterian and in 1982 reported her hobbies as reading and\nlistening to good music.\n\nHedberg was living in Columbia, South Carolina, at the time of her death in 2002\non her ninety-\ufb01fth birthday. She was survived by two brothers, a sister, and several\nnephews and nieces and was buried in Greenlawn Memorial Park in Columbia. Af-\nter her death, Hedberg\u2019s estate left $1,000,000 for the establishment of the Wyman\nLoren Williams and Ernest Albert and Marguerite Zeigel Hedberg Chair of Math-\nematics at the University of South Carolina.
